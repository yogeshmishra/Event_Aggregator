Combat "torrent" of misery in world, Pope Francis says in New Year messageVATICAN CITY:   Pope Francis , in his first message of the new year, on Friday urged people to combat the "torrent" of misery, injustice and violence in the world by overcoming all indifference to the many who are suffering.   Security was tight. Police checked the bags of people blocks away from St. Peter's Square and about 10,000 people went through additional, airport-style screening to get into   St. Peter's Basilica  and hear Francis celebrate Mass.   "We ask how long human evil will continue to sow violence and hatred in our world, reaping innocent victims ... we are witnessing hordes of men, women and children fleeing war, hunger and persecution, ready to risk their lives simply to encounter respect for their fundamental rights," the pope said.   In his homily he urged people to overcome what he called "a torrent of misery" by "building an ever more just and fraternal world, a world in which every person and every creature can dwell in peace, in the harmony of God's original creation".   The 79-year-old looked and sounded well despite having made many public appearances over the Christmas and New Year season.   He called on everyone, on the day the 1.2 billion-member   Roman Catholic Church  marks its annual World Day of Peace, to "let ourselves be reborn, to overcome the indifference which blocks solidarity, and to leave behind the false neutrality which prevents sharing".

Delhi out of UNESCO tag race in 2015; eyes on Nalanda in 2016 NEW DELHIL: The city of   Delhi  being pulled out of the race for the   UNESCO  Heritage List was one of the biggest dampeners in the field of art and culture in 2015, while the ruins of ancient   Nalanda  University vying for the coveted tag this year will bring some cheer to heritage lovers looking forward to a hopeful 2016.    The Centre earlier last year had decided to "pull out" the nomination of Delhi as the World Heritage City, saying the prestigious tag, if granted, will put "lot of restrictions" on carrying out infrastructure works in the national capital.    The two areas listed in the dossier sent to UNESCO were -- Shahjahanabad in old Delhi which has Mughal-era heritage and Lutyens' Bungalow Zone (LBZ) in New Delhi, part of the new imperial capital designed by Sir Edwin Landseer Lutyens and Sir Herbert Baker after the 1911 Delhi Durbar.    A team from INTACH's city chapter had prepared the "voluminous" nomination dossier sent by the Centre in January 2014. The Union Ministry of Culture had sent the initial nomination to the UNESCO in 2012.    A team from the world body had visited the city in October to examine the heritage sites mentioned in the dossier.    The decision to pull out Delhi barely a few months before its fate was to be decided at the 39th Session of the World Heritage Committee in Bonn, had left heritage experts and lovers disheartened.    But with the ancient ruins of Nalanda in Bihar up for consideration of the tag this year, the news has brought some cheers post-Delhi gloom.    Nalanda is the 2015 entry from the country for the UNESCO World Heritage City tag in the cultural heritage segment in pursuance of which the Ministry of Culture through the Archaeological Survey of India had sent an over 200-page-long nomination dossier on January 23 last year.    The university's construction began in 6th century AD and it flourished under the Gupta Empire. Its end came in 12th century when it was ransacked, looted and burnt in 1193 AD by the invading Turk Army led by its commander Bakhtiar Khilji.    An expert from Paris-based International Council of Monuments and Sites also visited the ruins of the university, situated in Nalanda district, about 90 km from Patna, to evaluate India's bid in pursuance of the coveted tag. Bihar currently has over 70 ASI-protected heritage monuments and sites under the Patna Circle, and only one UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya in Gaya district. The Nalanda ruins, which fall under this Circle, is spread over 23 hectares.   Delhi, on the other hand has three World Heritage Sites -- Qutub Minar, Red Fort and Humayun's Tomb.   2015 offered another reason to cheer for history and heritage lovers, thanks to some of the ambitious projects taken up by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC), a non- profit organistaion, which works for revitalisation of cultural heritage around the world.   The AKTC is building the country's first sunken museum at the Humayun's Tomb on behalf of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) with a funding of Rs 49 crore from the Ministry of Tourism, and for the project began on April 7 last year.   Inspired by the baolis (underground wells) of northern India, and set to be completed by 2017, it will showcase the heritage of the Nizamuddin Area over the last seven centuries.   Prince Karim Aga Khan, while laying the foundation stone of the museum, said, "As I have said during the opening of the restored tomb one-and-a-half years ago, we are working in a magnificent partnership, and it holds true for this museum project as well... And, valuable conservation lessons learnt here will make this site a model for other monuments around the world."   The iconic museum will be located at the entrance zone of the World Heritage Complex and would serve as a bridge between the three sites of Nizamuddin, Sunder Nursery and the 16th century tomb.   On April 18, the World Heritage Day, the city received a gift as Mughal-era Batashewala garden tomb complex was thrown open to public after painstaking restoration that lasted over a period of four years.   Neighbouring the Humayun's Tomb, the 11-acre complex had suffered decades of neglect and inappropriate development.   Headquartered in New Delhi, Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), expanded its footprint in Bihar, by opening its Bhagalpur Chapter in the state, its 188th chapter, on December 19.   Besides the ASI, INTACH works on protection, conservation and promotion of tangible and intangible heritage, through its chapters spread across the country in various cities.   The opening of the new chapter in Bihar's 'Silk City' has generated good response, and the INTACH Bihar Chapter seeks to use the platform to boost its efforts to document and preserve old buildings and landmarks in the historic city this year onwards.

Har-ki-Pauri goes Wi-FI, devotees welcome moveDEHRADUN:   Har-ki-Pauri  in Haridwar, where hundreds of pilgrims will converge for the Ardh Kumbh, which is starting on January 14, has been transformed into a   Wi-Fi  zone. The first 15 minutes of use shall be free of cost and thereafter, depending on need, one can do instant recharge.   Sri Ganga Sabha, which looks after the upkeep of Har-ki-Pauri, felt the need to be a part of "digital India". President of the Sri   Ganga Sabha  Puroshotam Sharma Gandhiwadi said, "The drive was much needed as we want to spread our mythology among the digitally advanced population of the country. Also, it is our quest to promote Vedic culture in the globe, which in recent years has shown great interest in Hindu mythology. Now, all those spiritually hungry people can see Ganga 'aarti' live from any part of the world through Wi-Fi."   In the coming months, the sabha is planning to implement a few more innovative steps to "keep step with the rapidly changing developing world".   According to officials of the Ganga Sabha, security and safety were the major concerns due to which in the past they were reluctant to allow installation of the Wi-Fi facility in the Har-ki-Pauri premises.   "Once we got an assurance from   BSNL  that their Wi-Fi will not create any untoward environment and breach security, only then did we give them the go-ahead. We have told them that we will stop the facility if we see any kind of misuse of Wi-Fi by the people," said Purushotam.   Currently, the department has installed nine axis points at Har-ki-Pauri. Each point covers a 200-meter area of the ghat.   Government-owned BSNL said the agency will extend the facility across all the ghats of   Haridwar  soon. "It's a New Year gift for the pilgrims visiting Haridwar. We will see the response of people and gradually extend the facility across all the ghats of Haridwar and thereafter in Rishikesh," said Isam Singh, general manager, BSNL, Haridwar.   It is expected that in the coming days, Mansa Devi and Chamunda Devi temples on the hilltop will also be covered by Wi-Fi.

Dutch firm to study feasibility of Bhalaswa SLF reclamationNEW DELHI: North Delhi Municipal Corporation has appointed a Netherlands-based consultancy firm to carry out a feasibility study for re-use of the mammoth garbage dumped at the Bhalaswa sanitary landfill (SLF) in north west Delhi.   The Bhalaswa landfill, used for disposal of garbage generated in Civil Lines, Karol Bagh, Rohini, and West and Najafgarh zones of NMDC area, has completed its sanitation capacity life but due to lack of alternative site it is still being used, said a senior municipal corporation officer.   "The Department of Environment Management Services (DEMS) has replaced the previous consultant and appointed the Netherlands based consultant M/s Novax which will conduct a feasibility study of the SLF for its reclamation," the officer said.   The civic body had earmarked Rs 5 crore in its 2016-17 budget for the purpose of preparing the landfill site for re-use.   Tenders will be issued soon for preparing the Bhalaswa site for reclaiming it and also for generation of electricity from garbage dumped there.   The SLF which was started in 1993 is being used for dumping hundreds of tons of garbage everyday despite expiry of its sanitation life. It has attained a height of nearly 30 metres giving it an appearance of a hillock.   The reclamation process will involve digging up the landfill site and use the cleared space for dumping more garbage. The garbage will be segregated before being dumped and only organic portion of it will be dumped here so that its sanitation life capacity could be extended significantly, said the officer.   The DEMS committee has also proposed to install advertisement billboards on the overgrown landfill site to diminish its unsavoury look. Tenders will be issued soon for preparing the Bhalaswa site for reclaiming it and also for generation of electricity from garbage dumped there.
Cultural sequence of Sarnath identified: ASIVARANASI: Fresh excavation works to ascertain the actual age of Sarnath, the site where Lord Buddha delivered his first sermon, has identified the tentative cultural sequence of the site from 4th Century BC to 6th Century A.D.   The earlier known history of Sarnath dates back to 3rd Century BC to 12th Century AD and the excavation was aimed at finding the cultural sequence.   Sarnath, located about 12 km from the ancient temple town of Varanasi, is the place where Gautam Buddha preached his first sermon after attaining enlightenment.   "ASI makes a conservation programme every year and we give first preference to the sites which are in danger. In the Sarnath circle, excavation work has been done six-seven times," as ASI official told PTI.   The last excavation works at Sarnath began on February 19, 2014 under the direction of B R Mani, Additional Director General of ASI, New Delhi, and under the supervision of Ajay Srivastava, Superintending Archaeologist of Sarnath Circle, Varanasi.   According to a recent report by the ASI, there were two main objectives of carrying out the excavation. Firstly, to ascertain the cultural sequence of the site prior to Mauryan Period, if any.   The second objective was to conduct horizontal excavation to trace out the structural remains, antiquities, potteries and other archaeological remains belonging to Buddha's time or before, if any.   On the basis of the excavation, the tentative cultural sequence of the site has been identified, and can be divided into four periods.   The first is Pre-Mauryan (4th Century B.C. to 3rd Century B.C.), second Mauryan (3rd Century B.C. to 2nd Century B.C.), third Sunga-Kushana (2nd Century B.C to 4th Century A.D.) and fourth Gupta Period (4th Century A.D to 6th Century A.D.), the report said.   On the basis of excavation done at a particular location at Sarnath, the ASI found a black ware dish of medium size, and in the interior of the dish there was a stamped design, similar to marks found in Pre-Mauryan punch-marked coins. Besides this, an earthen hearth of Pre-Mauryan Period was found.   To corroborate the existence of Mauryan Period, the ASI found remains of architectural activities and ruins of burnt bricks and brickbats, suggesting that during this period the houses were made by burnt bricks by using mud as mortar.   Also, in the trenches laid on the North-Western side of the Ashokan Pillar and almost 30 meters towards Malgandh Kuti shrine, the surface level appeared as the remains of Sanga-Kushana Period. The potteries of this period are dominant and are mostly Red Ware, Dull Red Ware and a few of Black Ware.   Period IV at Sarnath excavation represents the Gupta period, mainly with Red Ware and Red Slipped Ware as the common potteries found. At one place, six images of Buddha made in typical Gupta style were found. In these, the figures of Buddha are shown slender with a swaying body, representing the main features of Sarnath School of Art.   In addition to this, many bricks with molded and chiseled decoration belonging to the Gupta period, were recovered.   According to official records, the archaeological significance of the place was first brought to notice in 1798 by J Duncan, who gave an account of the casket of green marble inside a stone box exposed by the workmen of Jagat Singh, the Dewan of King Chet Singh of Benaras while dismantling the Dharmarajika stupa to exploit building materials.   The antiquities recovered from Sarnath have been preserved in the adjoining site museum maintained by the ASI. In addition to this, many bricks with molded and chiseled decoration belonging to the Gupta period, were recovered.
