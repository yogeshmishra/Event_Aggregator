Hackers hunt for desi moles to ensure that no info is leaked to foreign spies : Delhi, News - India TodayA group of Indian hackers is gearing up to keep a close eye on serving and retired defence personnel to ensure they are not passing information to international spies on the virtual world. The move by hacking community is to ensure that no information is being leaked via social networking websites, which can be used against the nation. The step was taken after reports of defence personnel's involvement in the ISI spy racket surfaced. The Crime Branch of Delhi Police on Monday arrested IAF airman Ranjith KK, who was honey trapped by ISI agency by creating a fake profile on Facebook. He had been talking to "pretty woman" Damini McNaught for the last several months on Facebook and was passing sensitive details related to the Air Force. Recently, security agencies arrested serving and retired defence personnel from various locations who were leaking information to Pakistani security agency ISI. "We will follow the modus operandi used by international agents. We will track Indian officers and will try to get information from them. The moment they pass any information, we will alert the security agency giving proof against them," said a hacker who claims to be a part of ethical hacking community Anonymous-India. There are close to 2,000 retired and serving officers who are under the scanner of security agencies for suspectedly passing information for money or through honey trap. Admitting the process of tracking is illegal, hackers said the move is in national interest. "It is an illegal and a time taking process but the underground community is ready for surveillance to shield the country from outsiders," said a hacker on the condition of anonymity. Cyber experts claim that international spies from countries like Pakistan, US and China have maximum interest in gathering information from India. The international spying agencies, in order to make their spying activities seamless, untraceable and invisible, also carry out high-tech attacks which compromise the computer and network, but they carry out targeted attack on social media so that they get insider classified information. "Spies have created many fake profiles on social media. These profiles are of different nature which includes different sex, age, cast and nationality with distinct interests. They use it according to their targets. A dedicate team of spies is working to track vulnerable people on social media," said cyber crime expert Kislay Choudhary, who works closely with Delhi and Noida police. "As a person discloses that he works for Army, Navy or the Air Force, he/she comes on the radar of international spies who start following them on the virtual world. By some means, which includes honey trap, they start interacting with the user. Spies also keep a track of their interest or hobbies to make a conversation and get friendly," Choudhary explained.

CHINA-MILITARY 2 LAST : PTI feed, News - India TodayXi also called on the PRF to enhance nuclear deterrence Xi also called on the PRF to enhance nuclear deterrence and counter-strike capacity which is credible and reliable, medium- and long-range precision strike ability, as well as strategic check-and-balance capacity to build a strong and modern Rocket Force, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.  Noting that the PLA Army is the oldest force led and founded by the CPC, Xi praised its long history, "tremendous military exploits and immortal deeds".  "The PLA Army has played an irreplaceable role in defending national sovereignty, security and development interests," Xi said.  He called on army soldiers to embrace honourable traditions, adapt to changing situations in the digital age and explore new patterns in land battles.  The army needs to optimise its structure and composition, expedite its transformation from regional defence to universal fighting and build itself into a powerful modern land force.  A new force in safeguarding national security, the SSF represents "an important growth point" of the Chinese military in modern war, Xi said.  Xi called on the soldiers of the force to achieve leapfrogging development in key fields, set a high bar and strive to build a strong modern strategic support force.  Under the new structure of the military command system all wings of PLA will operate under a joint operational command.  China has seven military area commands - Beijing, Nanjing, Chengdu, Jinan, Shenyang, Lanzhou and Guangzhou.  Of these, Chengdu is responsible for security along the border with Indias eastern sector in the Tibet region along Arunachal Pradesh while Lanzhou looks after partly the western sector, including Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.  As per the new strategic zone plan announced by Xi, both Chengdu and Lanzhou get integrated into strategic command region making them perhaps the biggest operational areas for the Chinese military.

China upgrades status of strategic missile forces : PTI feed, News - India TodayFrom K J M Varma  Beijing, Jan 1 (PTI) In a major revamp of its 2.3 million million strong military, China today elevated the status of its strategic nuclear missile forces of its army, navy and air force and formed a new force to provide electronic and cyber intelligence backup for precision missile strikes in war.  In the newly revamped structure, Chinas powerful missile force, the Second Artillery Corps (SAC) which was formed in 1966 has been renamed as Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) Rocket Force (PRF) and announced the formation of PLA Strategic Support Force (SSF).  With a variety of short-, medium- and long-range nuclear and conventional missiles, Chinas missile force is regarded as one of the biggest in the world.  Yesterday, China confirmed reports of PLA conducting scientific tests of a railcar-based long-range missile capable of hitting targets across the US.  Inaugurating the PRF and SSF, President Xi Jinping today conferred military flags on the general command of the two new units at a ceremony.  CCTV said besides renaming the missile force, Xi who is also the head of the military, elevated the status of the new force with the army, navy and air force. The two new forces will not be "subordinating forces".  While the PRF with number of missiles will carry on as a strategic deterrence force, the job of the SSF will be to provide proper electronic intelligence to it in times war.  The new forces which is part of the cyber warfare will play in important role Chinas plans to win "information wars", it said.

Inaugurating the forces Xi who is the Chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission (CMC) which oversees all military forces said the formation of the Rocket Force and Strategic Support Force is a major decision by the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) to realise the Chinese dream of a strong military, and a strategic step to establish a modern military system with Chinese characteristics.  It will be a key milestone in the modernisation of the Chinese military and will be recorded in the history of the peoples armed forces, said Xi who is also the general secretary of the CPC.

2015 marked unprecedented acrimony between AAP govt and Centre : PTI feed, News - India TodayBy Sourav Roy Barman  New Delhi, Jan 1 (PTI) Delhi witnessed an unprecedented political acrimony between the  Arvind Kejriwal  government and the BJP-ruled Centre in 2015 which earlier saw the Aam Aadmi Party making history by storming to power with an overwhelming haul of 67 seats in the 70-member assembly.  The animosity that emerged over the appointment of Shakuntala Gamlin as the acting Chief Secretary by the Lt Governor, against the ruling AAPs opinion, turned full circle with the CBI raids at the Delhi Secretariat in December and the ensuing political firestorm.  As the conflict raged on, words flew thick and fast, often lowering the quality of public discourse, and both sides exchanged letters, claiming rightful authority over administrative jurisdiction.  As matters came to a head over the appointment of Swati Maliwal as Delhi Commission for Women chief (DCW) in July, Lt Governor Najeeb Jung proclaimed, "In respect to the NCT (national capital territory) of Delhi the Government means the Lieutenant Governor of the NCT of Delhi."  Steps towards fulfilling key poll promises like slashing water and power tariff, passing the Jan Lokpal Bill and a set of radical measures to combat the growing menace of air pollution under public and judicial pressure would also count among the focal points of the Kejriwal government.  The government announced a series of radical measures to mitigate rising pollution in the city, chief among them the introduction of the odd-even policy, under which vehicles bearing odd and even registration plates plied on alternate days starting today.  The first standoff occurred within days of Jung appointing senior bureaucrat Gamlin as acting Chief Secretary of the city government in June, in the temporary absence of K K Sharma, notwithstanding strong reservations by the Kejriwal dispensation which termed the decision as "unconstitutional".  Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) became another sticking point with the body being headed by two simultaneous heads at one point, LG-appointed M K Meena and the other, S S Yadav, authorised by the AAP government.  Kejriwal accused Prime Minister  Narendra Modi  of taking over the anti-graft body using "paramilitary" personnel on June 8, which he said was aimed at weakening AAPs fight against corruption.  The genesis of the faceoff over CBI raids at the Delhi Secretariat, at the fag end of the year, lay in a complain filed in July by senior bureaucrat Ashish Joshi, former member-secretary of the Delhi Dialogue Commission (DDC), with the ACB against Kejriwals secretary Rajender Kumar, accusing him of allegedly indulging in corruption.

UNSC admits need to consult troop-contributing countries : PTI feed, News - India TodayFrom Yoshita Singh  United Nations, Jan 1 (PTI) Echoing Indias concerns, the UN Security Council has acknowledged that troop contributing countries are not sufficiently consulted over peacekeeping mandates and stressed on the importance of "effective consultations" and their "full participation" to improve peace operations.  The 15-nation Council, in a presidential statement, issued here yesterdaysaid that it recognises that sustained consultations with the Secretariat and troop and police contributing countries are essential for a "shared understanding of appropriate responses and their implications for the mandate and conduct of an operation".  The powerful UN body, however, admitted that current consultations among the Security Council, troop and police-contributing countries and the Secretariat "do not meet their expectations and have yet to reach their full potential".  "The Security Council recognises that the experience and expertise of troop and police contributing countries in theatres of operation can greatly assist the planning of operations.  The Security Council stresses the importance of substantive, representative and meaningful exchanges and underscores the importance of full participation by the three stakeholders so that meetings are useful and productive," the UNSC said in the statement.  India has repeatedly criticised the Security Council over the lack of accountability and transparencyin the framing of peacekeeping mandates and has said that this "failing" by the world body is resultingin rising casualties among peacekeepers and civilians.  Indias PermanentRepresentative to the UN Asoke Mukerji, who retired last month, has said at various UN fora that the SecurityCouncil must consult troop contributing countries before drawingup peacekeeping mandates given that troops now have tofunction is increasingly difficult and hostile conflictsituations across the worlds hot-spots.  Mukerji had said that Article 44 of the UN Charter clearly calls on the Security Council to invite Member States not represented in the Council to participate in the decisions of the Security Council concerning the employment of contingents of that Members armed forces but lamented that "this hardly ever happens in actual practice".  He had stressed that troop and police contributing countries can play a role in assisting the Council to determine the kind and number of troops required for the proposed mandate, the nature of equipment required, and the costs of operating in the specific terrain of the theatre of operations.  India is the largest cumulative troop contributor to UNpeace operations, with over 185,000 troops having served in 48of the 69 missions mandated so far.  Issuing the presidential statement, the Council noted, in particular, the view of the High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations and the Secretary-General that the lack of effective dialogue among those stakeholders had generated frustration on all sides and undermined mandate implementation.  Further, the Council recognised that those consultations failed to reach their full potential despite the existence of many mechanisms, such as the Working Group, formal and informal dialogues, the General Assembly?s Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, and the Military Staff Committee.

Gadkari for more use of inland waterways : PTI feed, News - India TodayPanaji, Jan 1 (PTI) Union Minister  Nitin Gadkari  today proposed "optimising" the use of inland waterways through new ventures like sea planes and amphibious buses to bring down the dependability and burden on road transport.  "We should allow new ventures like sea planes, amphibious buses and even jetties by private hotels provided they will allow it to be used for public," the Highways and Road and Shipping Minister said after laying the foundation stone for a new parallel bridge over Zuari river near here.  He said the Union ministry will subsidise the creation of jetties so that the inland waterways can be used to optimum level.  "We can even introduce electric buses near airports which will take the tourists to port and through ship they can go to their hotels. This will be a tourist attraction," he said.  He said the government will support fishermen to fish outside the traditional limit of 12 nautical miles, where the fish catch is more.  "The jurisdiction of state is within 12 nautical miles where there is no fish and outside that limit the fishing is not happening. We have to bridge this disparity," the minister said.  Gadkari said the government can purchase big trawlers and hand them over to fishermen cooperative societies.  "Every day, certain amount of profit can be kept with the government. Once the entire amount is paid the trawler can be owned by the society," he said, adding that this move will help fishermen create more employment opportunities.

Tejas eyes export, to fly in Bahrain Airshow : PTI feed, News - India TodayNew Delhi, Jan 1 (PTI) Indias Light Combat Aircraft Tejas will take part in Bahrain International Airshow this month to explore export potential in what will be the first time the indigenously developed plane will fly outside the Indian air space.  Besides the fighter and naval version of Tejas, India will also showcase state-of-the-art airborne platforms and associated sensors and communication systems designed and developed by DRDO.  During the Bahrain International Airshow, being held at Sakhir Airbase, Bahrain from January 21-23, DRDO along with some of its production partners is displaying Indias strength in advanced defence technology areas, with the aim of exploring the potential of exporting these advanced systems to friendly countries in the region, an official statement said.  The show will witness flying demonstration of the Tejas, the Four plus generation and highly cost effective fighter aircraft, it added.  The Indian Air Force plans to acquire 120 Tejas aircraft, with 100 of them having major modifications to its strike, radar, and mid air refuelling capabilities.  Though the DRDO has developed a naval version of the Tejas, the Navy is seeking a much stronger engine besides other changes.  It would be interesting to see which countries will evince interest in the light combat aircraft since Pakistan has already put out its aircraft JF 17, built in collaboration with China, in the open market.  It is speculated that an Asian country has evinced interest in the Pakistani aircraft.  The Comptroller and Auditor General of India had in May this year pointed out 53 significant shortfalls in Tejas Mark-I version that had reduced its operational capabilities and survivability.

20 hyper-sensitive airports lack counter terror plans : India, News - India TodayTwenty hyper-sensitive Indian airports lack counter terrorist contingency plans covering their approach roads and it is "quite scary" that eight these airports are also not covered by CISF, a Parliamentary panel has said, stressing the urgent need for an aviation security policy "before an untoward incident takes place".  The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture, in a latest report, said it found "it quite scary to know that the security of eight of our hyper- sensitive and 19 of our sensitive airports are not covered by the CISF which has now become the only specialised force for aviation security;  "Now, the question is who is then guarding these airports and how secure these airports are?"  The panel also found serious deficiency in crucial security gadgets at several airports and commented that "aviation security has not received the attention and importance that it deserves."  "Counter Terrorist Contingency Plan (CTCP) by CISF at approach roads are available only at Delhi and Mumbai. The same needs to be put in place at 20 more international and hyper-sensitive airports ... The Committee recommends that Airport Security should be absolute," the panel headed by TMC Rajya Sabha MP K D Singh said in the report tabled in Parliament during the Winter Session.  Under the existing threat perceptions, "the country can ill-afford such a situation to continue any more. The Committee finds that aviation security has not received the attention and importance that it deserves," it said, adding there was "an urgent need" to have an Aviation Security policy to ensure fool proof security at airports "before a major untoward incident takes place in the country."  Currently, out of 98 operational airports in India, 26 airports are categorised as hyper-sensitive, of which 18 are under CISF security cover while 56 categorised as sensitive of which 37 airports have CISF deployment.  Another 16 are normal category airports with four of them being under the CISF cover.

Delhi's odd-even plan takes baby steps to better air quality : India, News - India TodayDelhi took its baby steps to combat worsening air quality in the capital with the odd-even plan experiment put into force by the  Arvind Kejriwal  government. Authorities said 150 cars were challaned for driving even-numbered cars today when odd-numbered cars were allowed on the roads apart from those exempt. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said he was overwhelmed by the people's response to the vehicle rationing plan. "Delhi has done it. By and large, Delhiites have taken this anti-pollution drive with open heart. Overwhelmed by the response of people we have received so far. I hope Delhi will show the way to the rest of the country," Kejriwal said. Kejriwal himself later told a TV channel that the measure culd curb pollution on a temporary basis and was not a permanent solution. Delhi Police Commissioner BS Bassi appealed to Delhiites to cooperate with the authorities so that the plan is implemented successfully. "I appeal to people to cooperate with us for the coming 15 days," Bassi said. Though BJP MP and former Mumbai Police chief Satyapal Singh was stopped at India Gate today for travelling in even-numbered car, the MP's car was exempt as per the odd-even plan. "We thank people of Delhi for making the scheme a success on the first day. The same Delhi, which was called selfish, has shown the way. We thank all people for choosing their children's health," Delhi's Transport Minister Gopal Rai said. Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi , the Union Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs, welcomed the initiative. But criticised the Delhi Government for making the scheme a political issue. Meanwhile, weather conditions added to the depression despite Delhi's stellar turnout. Officials of the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) had said on Thursday that air quality in Delhi was expected to deteriorate over the next few days with a fall in minimum temperature and calm wind movement. Officials said the air quality remained "very poor" on Friday due to atmospheric conditions that did not allow pollutants to get dispersed. While a section of the ruling AAP attributed the sharp drop in PM 2.5 figures between early morning hours and afternoon to the car rationing experiment, scientists said pollutants usually touch their peak in the dawn and then gradually fall. SAFAR stations, located in various areas the city, displayed 'very poor' real-time Air Quality Index, which was in line with the forecast of the Union government body that was released on Friday. In no marked change from Friday, the average levels of PM 2.5 was around 180 microgrammes per cubic metre, three times above the safe limit of 60. The corresponding safe limit of PM 10 is 100. Central Pollution Control Board's real time AQI for the Punjabi Bagh, R K Puram, NSIT Dwarka and Anand Vihar stations were 'severe' at 5 PM. "The boundary layer, beyond which pollutants cannot escape, comes near the earth's surface during the early morning hours resulting in the accumulation of pollutants. So the spike that was observed around 5.30 AM and the subsequent fall is understandable," SAFAR project director Gufran Beig said.

ODDEVEN-POLICE 2 LAST : PTI feed, News - India TodayCivil Defense volunteers were seen handing over flowers Civil Defense volunteers were seen handing over flowers and leaflets to offenders, making them aware of the various aspects and significance of the ambitious scheme.  Bassi had earlier clarified that no volunteer shall work independently and no vigilantism will be permitted.  The Delhi police had suggested the AAP government to allow women not having a driving licence or not knowing how to drive to travel with a male driver, but the proposal was shot down, Bassi said.  Women, who are not travelling with a male above 12 years of age, pertain to one of the several exempted categories.  "We thought in the interest of women safety that another exception could be made in favour of women travelling alone with a driver.  "This suggestion has not been accepted by the government. So now, If any woman travels with a (male) driver, in violation of the scheme, such a driver shall be liable for prosecution," Bassi told PTI.  The fortnight-long odd-even scheme kicked in today and the Delhi government expects it to bring down air pollution substantially.  The Delhi government has decided to restrict plying of private cars bearing odd and even registration numbers to alternate days from January 1 to 15 as part of the first phase of the scheme.  Private cars having odd registration numbers will be allowed to ply on odd dates and those with even numbers on even dates.  Those caught violating the scheme will have to pay a penalty of Rs 2,000.  "Today is the day of odd numbered cars and the even ones plying on the road are being prosecuted keeping in mind a number of exemptions briefed to us," said a traffic official on field.

15 killed in Egypts ferryboat accident : PTI feed, News - India TodayFrom Youssra El-Sharkawy  Cairo, Jan 1 (PTI) At least 15 people were killed when an unlicensed Egyptian ferry carrying unknown number of people capsized in worlds largest river Nile near here, officials said today.  The ferryboat sank last night as it was crossing between the two villages Kafr El-Sheikhs Sendion and Beheiras Derot, Kafr el-Sheikh governor El-Sayed Nasr said in a statement.  Rescue teams have recovered 15 bodies and are currently searching for more possible victims.  The reason of the accident is under investigation, but excess weight on board or bad weather conditions could be the possible reasons, Nasr said.  Egypt witnessed heavy rains and cold temperatures yesterday that led to several traffic accidents in different cities.  As many as 36 people had drowned in Nile, worlds largest river at 6,853 km, last year when a party boat collided with a cargo ship.  The government had promised new disciplinary measures to make Nile safer for transportation in the wake of the accident.

The Statesman: World welcomes New Year despite terror fearsNew Year's Eve kicked off in Sydney, but tightened security muted revelries in Europe with Brussels scrapping celebrations and fireworks cancelled in Paris as fears of jihadist threats cast a pall.  Australia's biggest city, Sydney, traditionally the first to host a major event to ring in the New Year, welcomed 2016 with spectacular midnight fireworks as crowds thronged to harbourside vantage points.  Pyrotechnics burst over the city in a colourful display which was expected to draw more than one million people, ahead of the chimes of midnight moving across Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Europe and finally the Americas.  In the heart of Europe, annual festivities and fireworks in Brussels have been cancelled as the Belgian capital -- home to NATO and the European Union -- remains on high alert.  "It's better not to take any risks," mayor Yvan Mayeur said.  Belgian officials are battling terror on two fronts -- with police today detaining six more people over an alleged New Year attack plot in Brussels as well as arresting a tenth suspect over last month's jihadist massacre in Paris.  Officials said two men had already been formally charged with terrorism-related offences and that police detained six more people Thursday for questioning over an alleged plot to strike "emblematic sites" in the Belgian capital during the end-of-year festivities.  Paris, still reeling from the November 13 slaughter of 130 people, has also cancelled its fireworks display.  But authorities agreed France's biggest public gathering since the attacks can go ahead on the Champs Elysees avenue, with bolstered security.  "The people of Paris and France need this symbolic passage into the New Year," said Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo.  "After what our city has lived through, we have to send a signal to the world," she told the weekly Journal du Dimanche.  Hong Kong, Beijing, Singapore and other Asian cities may rival Sydney's pyrotechnic splash, but Brunei will offer a sober evening after banning Christmas in a shift to hardline Islamic law.  Jakarta remains on high alert after anti-terror police foiled detailed plans for an alleged New Year suicide attack in the Indonesian capital.  Turkish police have detained two Islamic State suspects allegedly planning to stage attacks in the centre of the capital Ankara, expected to be packed on New Year's Eve.  In Moscow police will for the first time close off Red Square where thousands of revellers traditionally gather.  "It's no secret that Moscow is one of the choice targets for terrorists," Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin said recently.New Year, Terrorism
The Statesman: 4 nations to meet on Afghan peace talks on January 16The first round of quadrilateral meeting of Pakistan, Afghanistan, US and China will take place on January 16 to work out a clear and comprehensive road map for a meaningful Afghan peace process, Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Thursday.  The efforts to facilitate the Afghan reconciliation were started on the occasion of the "Heart of Asia" Conference in Islamabad on December 9.  Diplomatic efforts will get momentum with the meeting to revive the dialogue process between the Afghan government and the Taliban.  Pakistan earlier brokered the first ever face-to-face talks in early July and the second round was cancelled after the death of the Taliban leader Mullah Omar was revealed in late July.  All stakeholders are now making efforts to end the deadlock in the process that was necessary to stop the Taliban's Spring Offensive. The Taliban launch the annual offensive in late March or early April.  Asif told the senate the quadrilateral meeting will clearly demarcate responsibilities of each stakeholder at all stages.  Talking about the Army Chief General Raheel Sharif's recent visit to Kabul, he said the army chief carried a message to Kabul that the peace process would necessarily be Afghan-led and Afghan-owned.  "It was agreed that they will pursue peace and reconciliation with Taliban groups willing to join the process," the minister informed the upper house of the parliament.  Elements that would still continue to pursue violence will be dealt, under a mutually worked out framework, he declared.  All eyes are now on the four-nation meeting that was seen very significant to explore ways for the revival of the dialogue process.Afghanistan, Peace talks
The Statesman: France 'not finished with terrorism' says HollandePresident Francois Hollande said in his New Year's Eve address to the nation on Thursday that France "has not finished with terrorism yet".  Speaking six weeks after gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130 people in Paris, Hollande said the threat of another attack "remains at its highest level".  After a year in which jihadists also attacked the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a Jewish supermarket, Hollande said his "first duty" was to protect the French people.  "That means attacking the root of the evil, in Syria and Iraq. That is why we have intensified our air strikes against Daesh," he said, using another name for the Islamic State (IS) group.  Hollande said IS was suffering from the assault.  "The hits are taking their toll, the jihadists are in retreat, so we will continue as long as necessary," he added.  Hollande said he was "proud" of the French people for showing "solidarity and cool-headedness" after the attacks in January and in the wake of the carnage of November 13.  "Despite this tragedy, France did not give in," Hollande said. "Despite the tears, it remained upright. Confronted by hate, it showed the strength of its values, the values of the Republic."  More than 100,000 police are on duty across France for the New Year's Eve celebrations, including 11,000 in Paris where the traditional fireworks display has been cancelled this year.    Hollande, France, Terrorism
The Statesman: Punjab govt to focus on peace, communal harmony in 2016: BadalPunjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal said here on Thursday that the emphasis of the SAD-BJP government in 2016 would continue to be on peace, communal harmony and development.  "Punjab today is the most peaceful and the fastest developing state in the country. We are committed to preserve the peace and maintain the pace of development in the years to come," he said.  The Chief Minister, in his new year statement here, noted that despite the "vicious propaganda by our opponents", the government was able to take every challenge head-on with the never-say-die Punjabi spirit.  "This resolve will mark our functioning in the new year too," he said.  "In 2015, peace and communal harmony were put under severe strain by some rejected and cynical elements who were desperate to gain political relevance by taking political advantage by creating an atmosphere of suspicion, uncertainty and bitterness," he said.  Badal noted that such elements tried to revive their "divide and rule" card during this year and did not spare even the holy Shri Guru Granth Sahib from their political opportunism and adventurism.  "But the SAD-BJP responded with vigour and commitment and successfully mobilized the Punjabis to defeat those forces and save Punjab from being pushed back into the dark era of the 1980s and 90s," he said.  Badal described the incidents of sacrilege of Shri Guru Granth Sahib as the "most painful moments of my life" and said that he was pained to see politics being played even on this extremely sensitive issue. .  Badal said that the government's 'War on Drugs' showed definite results this year.  Stating that although a few stray but most unfortunate incidents, like the one in Abohar did take place, the government acted promptly and without prejudice and none of the accused was spared.  "There were in nine years about four or five incidents in all. We believe that even these incidents should never have happened. But these did not reflect the overall atmosphere in Punjab which remained peaceful and the rule of law prevailed everywhere," said Badal.  Listing the achievements of his government, the CM said that there were massive strides in every field .  "We made the state power surplus, something which our critics had described as a pipe dream. We also realized the impossible dream of putting the international airport in place. We continued free power to farmers and stepped up relief and help to the poor and dalit and other backward sections.  "We brought world class infrastructure to the state which today boasts of IIM, AIIMS and Post Graduate Institute of Horticulture Research. Punjab continues to get awards for the finest infrastructure and highest consumer purchasing power in the country," he said.  Badal said that the government was set to transform the face of the rural and urban Punjab with an unprecedented development.  He said that international agencies, including the World Bank have rated Punjab as one of the most investment friendly places in the world.Parkash Singh Badal ,  peace, communal harmony

The Statesman: India demands UNSC to consult more with troop-contributing nationsAdmitting that its consultation process with countries contributing troops to peacekeeping operations was flawed, the UN Security Council has called for regular and broader consultations, a demand India has consistently pushed throughout last year. These developments cap the tenure of Asoke Kumar Mukerji, who is retiring as India's Permanent Representative. He had waged a constant battle to get the Council to properly consult with troop-contributing countries as it issues and monitors peacekeeping mandates.  The Council recognised that the consultation process involving it, the troop contributors and the UN Secretariat "do not meet their expectations and have yet to reach their full potential," US Permanent Representative Samantha Power, the Council President for December, said in a statement released Thursday.  "The Security Council stresses the importance of substantive, representative and meaningful exchanges and underscores the importance of full participation by the three stakeholders so that meetings are useful and productive," Power said.  In June in one of several speeches at UN debates, on peacekeeping, Mukerji had crticised the Council saying it was "enforcing the will of a small privileged minority within the Council to look at peacekeepers as instruments to wage war." He cited its disregard of the UN Charter requirement for nations contributing troops "to participate in the decisions" of the Council on their deployment.  "India, for example, has not been so consulted," he said. "This despite the fact that India is the single largest contributor of troops to UN peacekeeping operations, having contributed more than 170,000 troops in 43 of the 69 peacekeeping operations mandated so far by the Council." India currently has 7,798 personnel serving the peacekeeping operations.  In her statement released Thursday, Power called for extending the scope of the interactions between the Council, the Secretariat and the troop-contributors. "These consultations must extend beyond the issue of mandates of operations, and to areas such as safety and security of peacekeepers, strategic force generation, gender, conduct and discipline, including allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse, implementation of protection of civilian mandates, capability, performance, equipment and national caveat," she said.  The US role in shepherding the commitment through the Council in the waning days of 2015 during Power's presidency adds to its weight. With the US military capability overextended, President Barack Obama has in a break from the past shown interest in rejuvenating UN peacekeeping operations. He had convened an international summit on the subject in September.  The Council also recognised the troop-contributing countries' on-the-ground expertise. Power said, "The experience and expertise of troop- and police-contributing countries in theatres of operation can greatly assist the planning of operations."  India has stressed the importance of continuing consultations to make use of the reservoir of experiences peacekeepers have. During a recent interview with IANS, Mukerji gave an example of the situation in South Sudan where Indian peacekeepers are deployed. Rights to graze cattle sparked conflicts between groups and these escalated, he said. While the Indian troops on the ground, who had been trained professionally to observe the conflict environment, were aware of it, the information had no avenue to reach the Council or the higher UN echelons, thus missing an opportunity to prevent the situation from escalating, he added.  Power said the Council also asked the Secretariat to consult with troop-and police-contributing countries when planning any change in military tasks, mission-specific rules of engagement, concept of operations or command and control structure or early peacebuilding that would impact personnel, equipment, training and logistics.  This meets another of the peacekeeping issue that India has raised about the Council changing mandates midway through a mission or introducing new elements that could affect the security of peacekeepers. The Council added a so-called intervention brigade in the Democratic Republic of Congo where Indian peacekeepers are deployed. India fears that its troops could become vulnerable to attacks stemming from the aggressive tactics mandated for the intervention brigades.UNSC, Troop contributing nations, United Nations
The Statesman: Novel ways to help drones move better in tricky hillsA group of scientists has developed a novel technology to enhance the movement of drones in the tough plateau mountain regions.  The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) designed for plateau missions are usually installed with high span chord ratio wings, which provides more lifting force at a relatively low airspeed.  The UAVs employ high span chord ratio wings but tend to lose their maneuverability.  Hence, they usually need larger turning radius and unable to maintain the altitude during sharp slope turning as the lifting force produced by the wings decrease dramatically when the bank angle is large.  The discarding of the flight performances may risk the safety of the flight in plateau mountain regions.  “The new Variable thrust direction (VTD) technology is a type of thrust vectoring control (TVC) approach that allows to manipulate the directions of thrust to the fuselage of the aircraft,” the authors noted in a paper published in the journal SCIENCE CHINA Information Sciences.  By the introduction of the VTD capability to the conventional propeller UAV, the maneuverability of the UAV has been greatly enhanced, since the VTD engine enables direct force control of the aircraft.  Most of the existing works are designed for jet engines, which cannot be applied to the conventional propeller engine aircraft.  The VTD mechanism allows redirecting parts portion of the thrust from the propeller engine to other directions rather than normal axial direction.  A combination flight controller for the VTD enhanced UAV is then proposed to coordinate the VTD controlled forces and aerodynamic surfaces forces.  “The newly developed VTD UAV was applied to implement plateau missions, which demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed technique,” the team added.New technology, drones
The Statesman: 9 'hardcore terrorists' set to be hanged in PakistanPakistan Army chief General Raheel Sharif confirmed the death sentences on the nine men who were sentenced for terror offences.

France 'Not Finished With Terrorism' Says  Francois HollandeParis, France:                              President Francois Hollande said in his New Year's Eve address to the nation Thursday that France "has not finished with terrorism yet". Speaking six weeks after gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130 people in Paris, Hollande said the threat of another attack "remains at its highest level". After a "terrible" year in which jihadists also attacked the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a Jewish supermarket and a heavily armed man attacked passengers on a high-speed train in France, Hollande said his "first duty" was to protect the French people. "That means attacking the root of the evil, in Syria and Iraq. That is why we have intensified our air strikes against Daesh," he said, using another name for the Islamic State (ISIS) group.

Hollande said he was "proud" of the French people for showing "solidarity and cool-headedness" after the attacks in January and in the wake of the carnage of November 13. "Despite this tragedy, France did not give in," Hollande said. "Despite the tears, it remained upright. Confronted by hate, it showed the strength of its values, the values of the Republic." The president was defiant on his plans to strip dual nationals who are convicted of terrorist offences of their French nationality. He said while it was "legitimate" to have a debate about the proposal that has deeply divided his Socialist party, "when it comes to your protection, France must not be divided". More than 100,000 police are on duty across France for the New Year's Eve celebrations, including 11,000 in Paris where the main fireworks display has been cancelled this year.

Belgium Holds Five Over 'New Year Plot'Brussels, Belgium:                              Belgian police were holding five people early Friday over an alleged New Year plot in Brussels and also arrested a 10th suspect over last month's attacks in Paris. Both Brussels and Paris cancelled annual New Year's Eve fireworks displays as soldiers and police ramped up security in European capitals over perceived terror threats. There were instead plenty of private firework displays throughout the Belgian capital at midnight, accompanied by cheers and loud music, but the celebrations were vastly diminished compared to last year's. "People are scared. They are staying home and avoiding public places," taxi driver Abdullah told AFP in the Ixelles neighbourhood as he waited for customers who he estimated have dropped 40 percent this year. Police detained six people Thursday for questioning over an alleged plot to strike "emblematic sites" in Brussels during the year-end festivities. But three of them were released after interviews and the others were ordered provisionally held for another 24 hours as the investigation continues, the federal prosecutor's office said. The prosecutor's office also said two men, whom they identified as Said S., 30, and Mohammed K., 27, had already been formally charged with terrorism-related offences and remained in custody. The men's lawyers said their full names are Said Saouti and Mohammed Karay, whose arrests were announced Tuesday following police raids in and around Brussels and the eastern city of Liege. The men denied the charges against them, the lawyers added. Police seized military-style training uniforms, computer hardware and Islamic State propaganda material in the earlier raids. In Thursday's raids, they found computer equipment, mobile phones and airgun equipment, the prosecutor's office said. A source close to the investigation told AFP that officials were trying to determine whether members of a motorcycle gang called the "Kamikaze Riders" were involved in the year-end plot. 'Terrorist murder' Brussels has been on high alert since it emerged that several of the attackers involved in the Paris carnage on November 13 had links to the Belgian capital. Prosecutors said Thursday they had arrested a 10th suspect over the attacks in Paris claimed by the Islamic State group that killed 130 people and wounded many more. They charged him with terror offences. The Belgian national, identified only as Ayoub B., was detained on Wednesday during a raid on a house in the troubled Brussels immigrant neighbourhood of Molenbeek, the federal prosecutor's office said. He has been charged with "terrorist murder" and involvement in the activities of a terrorist group, it said, adding that he would appear in court again within five days for a custody hearing. Molenbeek is home to the Paris attacks fugitive Salah Abdeslam and has served in the past decades as a haven for jihadists. Brussels Mayor Yvan Mayeur said Wednesday that fireworks and related events in the central square of Place de Brouckere had been cancelled because it was not possible to "guarantee that we can check everyone coming to the event". Last year, some 100,000 people turned out to watch the traditional New Year's Eve fireworks display. 'Terrorists are winning' Alex, another taxi driver, told AFP that "the terrorists are winning" as business had dropped by about half this year while some cafe owners said they were closing several hours early for lack of customers. It is not the first time the official New Year's Eve fireworks have been cancelled as the authorities made the same decision in 2007 because of another terror threat. Officials said the plot revealed Tuesday was not directly linked to the wave of bombings and shootings on a Paris concert venue, bars, restaurants and the national stadium.                Belgian police,New Year,New year 2016,New Year Attack Plot,New Year Terror ThreatBelgian police were holding five people early Friday over an alleged New Year plot in Brussels and also arrested a 10th suspect over last month's attacks in Paris.
'ISIS Suicide Attack'  Planned For New Year's Eve in Germany:  Officials                                                                            German officials said today the ISIS group was believed to be plotting a suicide bomb attack on New Year's Eve in the southern city of Munich. German authorities were tipped off by a "friendly intelligence service" about the plan, which ISIS had planned to carry out around midnight, said Joachim Herrmann, interior minister for the southern state of Bavaria. "Five to seven" suspects were believed to be planning to carry out a "suicide attack" as festivities were under way to welcome in the New Year, Munich police chief Hubertus Andrae said. Police evacuated Munich's main rail station and another station in the western suburb of Pasing after an alert of a possible "terror attack". Rail services at the sites were also halted and police urged the public to keep away from large gatherings. Some 550 officers had been deployed to track down the suspects and secure the sites, although no arrests have been made yet. Police officers, some in riot gear, were posted at different entrances of Munich's main rail station which was eerily quiet on a night of traditionally raucous celebrations. Some revellers sought to enter the station but were turned away. A police spokeswoman said it could not be ruled out that the attackers could seek another target. German media had earlier reported that police were acting on a tip from French authorities. European capitals are on high security alert, with Brussels and Paris both scrapping fireworks for New Year's celebrations. Belgian police were also holding five people over an alleged New Year plot in Brussels. In Berlin, police presence has been stepped up at the Brandenburg Gate, where hundreds of thousands of people have gathered for festivities. All large bags and backpacks have been banned from the site of the huge street party. Days after the November 13 attacks in Paris claimed by the ISIS group that left 130 dead, German police called off an international football match at the last minute due to a bomb threat. No explosives were subsequently found, and no arrests made after the Germany-Netherlands friendly in Hanover -- which was to be attended by Chancellor Angela Merkel -- was cancelled and thousands of fans evacuated. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere -- who had been due to attend the match with Merkel -- later said the event was cancelled "to protect the population", but did not provide specifics.

Explosion Hits Restaurant In Afghan Capital Kabul: PoliceKabul:                              A loud blast rocked the Afghan capital Kabul on Friday, apparently caused by a car bomb that targeted a restaurant popular with Afghan officials and foreign diplomats, a police official said. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media, said the explosion appeared to have hit "Le Jardin", one of a small number of restaurants in Kabul still frequented by foreigners. No information on damage or casualties was immediately available. The explosion came days after the Taliban claimed responsibility for a suicide attack near Kabul airport that killed one person and wounded 33 others, the latest in a series of suicide attacks in the city. The attacks have coincided with efforts to revive the stalled peace process with the Taliban that broke down in July. Officials from Afghanistan, Pakistan, the United States and China are due to meet in Pakistan on Jan. 11 for a meeting aimed at laying the ground for talks with the insurgents.   © Thomson Reuters 2016Kabul Blast,Afghanistan Blast,Afghaistan District,Afghaistan District Foreign Embassies,Afghaistan District Government Buildings,Kabul District Government Buildings,Kabul District Foreign Embassies,Afghan Police,Kabul PoliceA loud blast rocked the Afghan capital Kabul on Friday, apparently caused by a car bomb that targeted a restaurant popular with Afghan officials and foreign diplomats, a police official said.
Republic Day Parade To Be Short and Crisp This YearNew Delhi:                              The Republic Day parade this year will be shorter by at least 15 minutes. The government plans to hold a 90-minute parade instead of the nearly two hours, cutting down the number of marching military contingents and clubbing together the mechanised ones. The number of tableaux will also be fewer. Senior officials told NDTV that decision to cut down was taken at the "highest level". Last year -- when US President Barack Obama was the chief guest at the Republic Day parade - the march past was thought to be long. "Beating the Retreat" - that signals the end of the celebrations and returning of the contingents - will also undergo change, with Indian music being fused with martial tunes. Also, unlike previous January 26 celebrations, all tableaux and music bands will be showcased for three days - till January 29 - at the Red Fort to allow more people to participate. Top defence ministry sources told NDTV that the number of the Army's marching contingents has been reduced from 8 to six. The Navy will also be one contingent short - deploying 2 instead of the usual three.  The Air Force will be putting up a single marching contingent. The six Central para- military forces will be putting up only 3 marching contingents instead of one contingent each. The fly-past by the IAF, however, has been retained. The veterans of the forces will not march, they will ride in tableaux. Another possible change is that instead of individual mechanised contingents, composite contingents will be put up.   "Earlier, tanks, air defence, guns and artillery used to be showcased in individual columns. This year, several elements could be put in a single contingent, an officer said.   The Navy will showcase "Make in India" and put up models of the indigenously made aircraft carrier INS Vikrant and indigenously made submarine INS Kalvari. The Air Force will showcase its "Humanitarian and Disaster Relief" activity and put up models of the new acquired heavy transport aircraft C-130 Hercules, C-17 Globe Masters and the Mi-17 Helicopter, which are extensively used in relief and rescues activity. The Army will showcase the theme "Marching ahead with Incredible India". Also, the dais for this year's chief guest, French President Francois Hollande, President Pranab Mukherjee and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be covered. This decision was taken after last year's embarrassment, when President Obama and the US First Lady, along with President Mukherjee, had to brave rain during the parade.     US President Barack Obama and Vice President Hamid Ansari at last year's Republic Day Parade.

Taliban Suicide Bomber Hits French Restaurant In KabulKabul:                              A Taliban suicide car bomber struck a French restaurant popular with foreigners in Kabul Friday, killing two people in a New Year's day attack that marks the latest in a series of brazen insurgent assaults. Fifteen others were wounded in the attack on Le Jardin, an Afghan-owned eatery, which caused a piercingly loud explosion and left a building engulfed in flames. The attack comes a day after Afghanistan announced four-way talks in Pakistan on January 11, aimed at jump-starting peace negotiations with the resurgent Taliban. "We can confirm a suicide car bomb attack on Le Jardin," Fraidoon Obaidi, the head of Kabul's Criminal Investigation Department, told AFP. "We are busy extinguishing the fire at the scene... two Afghans have been killed and 15 others wounded," he added. The Italian-run Emergency Hospital in Kabul said on Twitter that the fatalities included a 12-year-old boy who was declared dead on arrival. Security forces cordoned off the area and firefighters and ambulances were seen rushing to the restaurant, which sports a large garden festooned with rose bushes and is a popular hangout for foreigners and wealthy Afghans. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid on Twitter claimed several foreigners had been killed and wounded in the suicide attack. Taliban insurgents routinely exaggerate the death toll in attacks on government and foreign targets. Friday's bombing evoked memories of an audacious Taliban attack on another restaurant popular with expats, the Taverna du Liban, in January 2014, which left 21 people dead, including 13 foreigners. Then, desperate customers tried to hide under tables as one attacker detonated his suicide vest at the fortified entrance to the eatery and two other militants stormed inside and opened fire. Uncertainty Over Talks The latest attack comes just days after Pakistan's powerful army chief General Raheel Sharif visited Kabul to try to prepare the ground for fresh peace talks with the resurgent Taliban. Both sides agreed to hold a first round of dialogue between Afghanistan, Pakistan, US and China on January 11 to lay out a comprehensive roadmap for peace, officials in Kabul said. Pakistan -- the Taliban's historic backers -- hosted a milestone first round of talks in July but the negotiations stalled when the insurgents belatedly confirmed the death of longtime leader Mullah Omar.   Afghan security officials stand alert as they block the road near the site of a suicide car bomb attack. (AFP photo) Afghanistan sees the support of Pakistan as vital to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table. But despite the growing bonhomie with Islamabad, analysts caution that any substantive talks are still a long way off. On Monday, just a day after Sharif's visit, a Taliban bomber detonated an explosives-packed vehicle near Kabul airport, killing one civilian in an attack targeting a NATO convoy. Observers say the intensifying insurgency highlights a push by the Taliban to make more military gains to try to achieve greater concessions during talks. Afghan forces are currently battling to push back Taliban insurgents who seized large swathes of the key opium-rich district of Sangin in the southern province of Helmand. The offensive has prompted the first British deployment to the volatile province in 14 months. The deployment, in addition to a recent arrival of US special forces in the region, comes a year after NATO forces formally ended their combat operations in the country. The British and US intervention has fuelled the perception that foreign powers are increasingly being drawn back into the conflict as Afghan forces struggle to rein in the Taliban.                  Kabul attacks,Afghan attack,Le JardinA Taliban suicide car bomber struck a French restaurant popular with foreigners in Kabul Friday, killing two people in a New Year's day attack that marks the latest in a series of brazen insurgent assaults.
Tatas, M&M may participate in Rs 12,700-crore Army fleet upgrade projectNEW DELHI: The   Army  is all set to reverse its decision to hand over a mega Rs 12,700-crore upgrade of its fleet of infantry combat vehicles to the public sector. The deal will now be opened up for the private sector as well, allowing top players like   Tata  and   Mahindra  to participate in the bid.    Sources familiar with developments have told ET that the new plan entails splitting the contract to modernise over 1,600 in-service BMP2   armoured vehicles  in two rounds. In the first phase, 640 of the Soviet origin infantry combat vehicles will be straight away put up for the private sector to bid on a competitive basis. Based on this, a final call will be taken on the remaining vehicles. The Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) is, however, lobbying hard to retain part of the balance contract.     Follow @ETDefence Twitter handle for comprehensive coverage on other buzzing Defence stories     ET has learnt that the army has already moved a formal note in December second week, reversing its earlier decision to upgrade all of the armoured vehicles through OFB. The decision presents a big opportunity to the private sector to acquire basic technology and knowhow on design,which, in turn, could help companies to aspire greater involvement in more challenging projects like the Futuristic Infantry Combat Vehicle (FICV).    The army had earlier proposed that the comprehensive upgradation of its BMP 2 armoured vehicles — to be modernised with new fire control systems, Kornet E anti-tank missiles and third generation night vision capability — be handed over the Medhak Ordnance Factory. As reported by ET in September, the private industry was up in arms against the move as it had its eyes set on the contract that was being seen as a key enabler.    It's believed that several companies also protested to the defence ministry against the move to hand over the project on non-competitive basis. The BMP 2 'Sarath' infantry combat vehicles are the mainstay of the mechanised infantry and have been in service since 1987. They are employed in various roles — from an armoured ambulance to an amphibious dozer, besides offensive combat missions.

2015 a mixed year for defence FDI & 'Make in India'; will 2016 be better for the sector?NEW DELHI: Even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA government aggressively pushed for 'Make in India' in the defence sector in 2015, it failed to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the sector with a paltry amount of Rs 56 lakh coming in since last year when norms were first eased by it.    Latest data shared by Minister of State for Defence Rao Inderjit Singh in parliament shows that in the period between October 2014 - September 2015, the   FDI  equity inflow into Defence Industries is a just Rs 56 lakh, at the bottom of the list of sectors that received foreign money.     Follow @ETDefence Twitter handle for comprehensive coverage on other buzzing Defence stories     This lackluster response of foreign investors is also the likely reason for another set of big changes that the government announced in November in defence FDI. The changes included FDI upto 49 percent through automatic route, permissions to be taken from FIPB beyond 49 percent, besides FVCI and portfolio being also permitted 49 per cent through automatic route.    The government has also made amendments to offsets policy by allowing "flexibility to the vendors in offset contracts." Also, delineating from past, 'services' has been restored as eligible offsets for military contracts, opening up a business potential of over $3 billion in immediate projects.    According to an ET report, the defence ministry is set to announce a set of radical changes in its offsets policy that will bring in investments worth billions of dollars into the defence and aerospace industry from foreign vendors that win Indian military contracts. With some new rules, set to be part of the Defence Procurement Policy 2016, the defence ministry and the armed forces buying the equipment will specify what they want as offsets for a particular deal.    The much anticipated defence deals during PM Modi's Russia visit did not come through, with only an agreement to jointly manufacture 200 Kamov 226T choppers saw the light of the day. Similarly, the deal for US-2 amphibious aircraft with Japan did not materialize during Shinzo Abe's India visit. The deal to buy 36 Rafale jets from France is now hoped to be signed during Francois Hollande's India visit as chief guest for Republic Day celebrations.    However, one cannot refute that 'Make in India' has opened a huge array of possibilities for private partnership in defence which can bolster manufacturing sector. FDI may not have come in as expected yet the ray of hope lies in many Indian companies steering towards indigenous production of defence items. In a significant boost for the Indian Navy, indigenously developed nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine INS Arihant is undergoing sea trials and is likely to be part of International Fleet Review 2016 to be held in Visakhapatnam. First of the Scorpene class submarines 'Kalvari' built by Mazgaon Dock was set afloat in October and will undergo extensive sea trials before commissioning into the Navy late next year.    The Indian Navy has unveiled a 15-year plan to achieve full indigenisation in all phases of warship construction, from ship-building to systems to weapons, and aligned it PM Modi's 'Make in India' dream.    We take a look at some prominent deals signed under 'Make in India' in 2015 and those that are expected to see a push in 2016:     > Russia's Rostec to form JV with HAL for making Kamov 226T choppers     In a fillip to the government's 'Make In India' drive, Russia's Rostec will form a joint venture with Indian PSU HAL for manufacturing Kamov 226T military helicopters in India.    During Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Russia visit an agreement was signed between the Russian Federation and the Republic of India on cooperation in the field of helicopter manufacturing. The document was signed in the presence of Russian President   Vladimir Putin  and Prime Minister   Narendra Modi .         In pic: Ka-226T    According to the document, the State Corporation Rostec will organize in India the production of the Russian Ka-226T and its modifications in the amount of not less than 200 units. The agreement also provides for the maintenance, operation and repair of helicopters and providing them with technical support.     > Boeing, Tata announce joint venture to manufacture aerostructures for Apache helicopter in India    Aviation major   Boeing  and Tata Advanced Systems announced a joint venture that will manufacture aerostructures for AH-64 Apache attack choppers, recently ordered by India, and collaborate on integrated systems development opportunities in India.         In pic: Apache helicopter    The joint venture will initially create a manufacturing centre of excellence to produce aerostructures for the AH-64 Apache helicopter and compete for additional manufacturing work packages across Boeing platforms, both commercial and defence.    "Boeing and Tata Advanced Systems intend to grow the JV partnership in the future with a focus on opportunities to collaborate on development and selling of integrated systems," a statement by Boeing said.    Boeing had recently received an order for 22 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters and 15 CH-47F Chinook heavy-lift helicopters.     > Aequs signs pact to supply components for Boeing's Chinook helicopter    Dutch firm Fokker Technologies, a division of GKN Aerospace, and Karnataka-based aerospace manufacturer Aequs Ltd signed an agreement to supply machined components for Boeing's Chinook heavy lift helicopter that India is also buying.         In pic: Chinook helicopter    Aequs was selected after a careful process of qualification, proving the ability and affordability through trial production, Boeing said in a statement.     > L&T outguns global rivals to bag Rs 5,000-crore   Indian Army  deal    India is finally set to get its own mobile howitzers that will reverse the longheld Pakistani battlefield edge on artillery guns.    The guns Pakistan have were supplied by the US ostensibly for the 'war on terror'. In a deal that would also fit the 'Make in India' mandate, domestic manufacturer   Larsen and Toubro  has emerged as the finalist for a $750-million (about Rs 5,000 crore) contract to supply 100 self-propelled artillery guns to the Indian Army.         In pic: K9 VAJRA-T howitzer  The 155 mm artillery guns are specially designed for operation in the desert areas bordering Pakistan and have been a longstanding requirement of the Army, officials said. India's concerns over Pakistan acquiring an edge in conventional warfare escalated in 2009 when the US supplied it 115 of the modern M 109A5 cannons as a "reward" for its assistance in the war on the Afghanistan border.    The Army had then accelerated its plans to procure a similar system, but the process dragged on for many years, with the defence ministry finally taking a call on the winner last week. Sources told ET that the K9 VAJRA-T howitzer, pitched by L&T in partnership with   Samsung , has been shortlisted for the contract.     >   Airbus  & Mahindra to jointly manufacture military helicopters    Airbus Helicopters and Mahindra Defence, a   Mahindra Group  subsidiary, announced a plan to produce helicopters to cater to India's military requirements.    The joint venture will be set up in the coming months, a statement by the two companies said.    "The tie-up is in line with our intent to develop an indigenous industrial ecosystem dedicated to helicopters," Guillaume Faury, Airbus Helicopters' president and CEO said in the statement, announcing the memorandum of understanding.    The two companies will now get into discussions to finalise the formation of the joint venture which, once set up, will act as the prime contractor for India's military helicopter tenders including the Reconnaissance and Surveillance Helicopter, the Naval Utility Helicopter and the Naval Multirole Helicopter procurement programmes.     > India, Russia to sign pact on spares for Su 30 fleet    Russia's top aircraft manufacturer Sukhoi is exploring the possibility of investing in an Indian joint venture (JV) for the maintenance and spares production of its combat aircraft Su 30 in what could make India a hub for the fighter fleets operating in the region.      In pic: Su 30    Atop Sukhoi executive told ET that the liberalised foreign direct investment (FDI) norms have opened the possibility of a JV and the Russian manufacturer is in talks with Indian private sector companies.     > India to buy 36 Rafale jets in fly-away conditions from France    Crossing a significant milestone in negotiations for the 36-aircraft Rafale fighter deal, India and France have firmed up an understanding on the offsets segment under which the French have agreed to invest 50 per cent of the deal's worth in related sectors.         In pic: Rafale fighter jet    Even as the deal was being reached, French aircraft manufacturer Dassault had already reached out to Indian companies in the defence and security industry for possible Make in India partnerships. Estimated at $4.5 billion, or about Rs 30,000 crore, this will make it one of India's biggest-ever offsets deals.     > BAE Systems offers to make 'ultralight' guns in India    BAE Systems, the world's leading gun maker, is yet to identify its main Make in India partner for the M777 ultra-light howitzer project.    The project, being set up as part of the recently cleared $700-million, or about Rs 4,450-crore, deal to acquire 145 M777 howitzers for the Indian Army, will benefit as many as 40 small and medium enterprises in the country.        In pic: M777 ultra-light howitzer    The US firm also plans to shift the final production unit of the howitzer to India and that this new facility would be its hub for worldwide orders. A total of over $200 million investments are to be made by BAE in India as part of its offset obligations for the deal under the 'Make in India' programme.

India's concerns over Pakistan acquiring an edge in conventional warfare escalated in 2009 when the US supplied it 115 of the modern M 109A5 cannons as a "reward" for its assistance in the war on the Afghanistan border.    The Army had then accelerated its plans to procure a similar system, but the process dragged on for many years, with the defence ministry finally taking a call on the winner last week. Sources told ET that the K9 VAJRA-T howitzer, pitched by L&T in partnership with   Samsung , has been shortlisted for the contract.     >   Airbus  & Mahindra to jointly manufacture military helicopters    Airbus Helicopters and Mahindra Defence, a   Mahindra Group  subsidiary, announced a plan to produce helicopters to cater to India's military requirements.    The joint venture will be set up in the coming months, a statement by the two companies said.    "The tie-up is in line with our intent to develop an indigenous industrial ecosystem dedicated to helicopters," Guillaume Faury, Airbus Helicopters' president and CEO said in the statement, announcing the memorandum of understanding.    The two companies will now get into discussions to finalise the formation of the joint venture which, once set up, will act as the prime contractor for India's military helicopter tenders including the Reconnaissance and Surveillance Helicopter, the Naval Utility Helicopter and the Naval Multirole Helicopter procurement programmes.     > India, Russia to sign pact on spares for Su 30 fleet    Russia's top aircraft manufacturer Sukhoi is exploring the possibility of investing in an Indian joint venture (JV) for the maintenance and spares production of its combat aircraft Su 30 in what could make India a hub for the fighter fleets operating in the region.      In pic: Su 30    Atop Sukhoi executive told ET that the liberalised foreign direct investment (FDI) norms have opened the possibility of a JV and the Russian manufacturer is in talks with Indian private sector companies.     > India to buy 36 Rafale jets in fly-away conditions from France    Crossing a significant milestone in negotiations for the 36-aircraft Rafale fighter deal, India and France have firmed up an understanding on the offsets segment under which the French have agreed to invest 50 per cent of the deal's worth in related sectors.         In pic: Rafale fighter jet    Even as the deal was being reached, French aircraft manufacturer Dassault had already reached out to Indian companies in the defence and security industry for possible Make in India partnerships. Estimated at $4.5 billion, or about Rs 30,000 crore, this will make it one of India's biggest-ever offsets deals.     > BAE Systems offers to make 'ultralight' guns in India    BAE Systems, the world's leading gun maker, is yet to identify its main Make in India partner for the M777 ultra-light howitzer project.    The project, being set up as part of the recently cleared $700-million, or about Rs 4,450-crore, deal to acquire 145 M777 howitzers for the Indian Army, will benefit as many as 40 small and medium enterprises in the country.        In pic: M777 ultra-light howitzer    The US firm also plans to shift the final production unit of the howitzer to India and that this new facility would be its hub for worldwide orders. A total of over $200 million investments are to be made by BAE in India as part of its offset obligations for the deal under the 'Make in India' programme.     Vladimir Putin,Samsung,Narendra Modi,Mahindra Group,Larsen and Toubro,L&T,Indian Army,FDI,Boeing,AirbusIn a fillip to the government's 'Make In India' drive, Russia's Rostec will form a JV with Indian PSU HAL for manufacturing Kamov 226T military helicopters in India.

Iran-US tensions flare over sanctions threat, rocket claimTEHRAN: Iran accused the United States of lying Thursday about alleged test-firing of rockets near an American warship and anger rose in Tehran at the spectre of new sanctions from Washington.   Iran's Revolutionary Guards denied that its naval forces had been involved in a December 26 incident in which the US said rockets came close to the   USS Harry S Truman  aircraft carrier in the strategic Strait of Hormuz.   The naval unit is responsible for securing Iranian interests in the Strait, a vital waterway for a large proportion of the world's oil, regularly patrolling the area and conducting exercises.   "The Guards' naval force had no exercise in the past week when the Americans claim that a missile or rocket was fired in the Hormuz Strait area," spokesman General Ramezan Sharif said.   The purported incident comes five months after Iran and world powers led by the US agreed a landmark deal -- yet to be finally implemented -- to limit the Islamic republic's nuclear programme in exchange for lifting economic sanctions.   A US military official said an Iranian vessel had test-fired several rockets near three Western warships including the aircraft carrier. A French frigate and the USS Bulkeley destroyer were also in the area.   Though the rockets were not fired toward any warship, their proximity to them and several commercial ships -- reportedly around 1,500 yards (metres) -- was "highly provocative", said the official, who was not authorised to be named.   Sharif, quoted on the Guards' website, accused the US of fabricating the incident -- which reportedly occurred after Iranian naval forces announced via radio that the test-firing was to begin.   "Publishing such lies in the current situation is more a psychological operation," Sharif said.   "The security and peace of the Gulf is of serious strategic importance to Iran. The Guards conduct exercises to increase our required preparedness at due times, based on our own schedule."   The nuclear deal was heralded by moderates, such as Iran's President Hassan Rouhani, who staked his reputation on the negotiations. But hardliners in Tehran as well as Republican lawmakers have denounced the agreement.   Several Republicans running for the White House have pledged to rip up the deal if they are elected in November 2016.   Since the accord was struck, Iran's military has conducted missile tests that were condemned by the US. Iran also recently aired footage on state television of an underground missile base.   On Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that the US was preparing fresh sanctions against companies and individuals in Iran, Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates over alleged links to Tehran's ballistic missile programme.   Such a step by the US Treasury Department would be the first American sanctions against Iran since the nuclear agreement and presents a potential barrier to its durability.   Although Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei explicitly endorsed the nuclear accord in October he warned that new sanctions, under any pretext, would constitute a violation.   The deal as it stands is due to come into effect on "Implementation Day", expected within weeks when UN monitors sign off that Iran has fulfilled its obligations and applied agreed curbs to its nuclear programme.   Rouhani criticised Thursday the apparent US moves, saying Iran's domestic defence had never been within the remit of the nuclear talks.   "If US continues its illegitimate interference w/ Iran's right to defend itself a new program will be devised to enhance missile capabilities," the president wrote on Twitter.   In a series of messages from his personal account he said "in response to new US #sanctions planned against Iran's ballistic missile program" he had "ordered the Defense Minister to expedite the program."   He did not detail what such a measure would involve but added: "We have never negotiated regarding our defense capabilities including our missile program & will not accept any restrictions in this regard."

Classmates build visitors' lounge to honour brave pilotsMUMBAI: Classmates of an   Indian Air Force  pilot killed during crash of the country's first multi-purpose civil aircraft and a flight cadet who died in an air crash at the   Air Force Academy , have built a visitors' lounge at their alma mater Sainik School, Satara to pay tributes to them.   The lounge, built at a cost of Rs 10.50 lakh which was contributed by them was handed over to the school at a recent get together of the 1990 batch.   Principal Group Captain S Majumder, who attended the ceremony in presence of the former students' parents and teachers, thanked the class of 1990 for their gesture towards Wing Commander Dipesh Shah and Flight Cadet Prasad Shendge.   Shah was killed when India's first multi-purpose civil aircraft   Saras  which he was flying crashed in the outskirts of Bengaluru in March, 2009.   Shah's classmate Dipak Thorat recalled that villagers from Seshagiri village near the crash site, had been all praises for the pilots for their presence of mind in skirting three petrol pumps and hundreds of houses in the vicinity before the crash.   Shendge, a Flight Cadet, who was at the Air Force Academy, Dundigul near Hyderabad, was killed when his aircraft Kiran crashed near Bidar in 1994.   Former teachers of Shah and Shendge recalled the pilots as dedicated and sincere students who also excelled in extra-curricular activities like swimming, horse riding and boxing.

UNSC admits India's concerns about need to consult troop-contributing countries UNITED NATIONS: Echoing India's concerns, the UN   Security Council  has acknowledged that troop contributing countries are not sufficiently consulted over peacekeeping mandates and stressed on the importance of "effective consultations" and their "full participation" to improve peace operations.   The 15-nation Council, in a presidential statement, issued here yesterday said that it recognises that sustained consultations with the Secretariat and troop and police contributing countries are essential for a "shared understanding of appropriate responses and their implications for the mandate and conduct of an operation".   The powerful UN body, however, admitted that current consultations among the Security Council, troop and police-contributing countries and the Secretariat "do not meet their expectations and have yet to reach their full potential".   "The Security Council recognises that the experience and expertise of troop and police contributing countries in theatres of operation can greatly assist the planning of operations.   The Security Council stresses the importance of substantive, representative and meaningful exchanges and underscores the importance of full participation by the three stakeholders so that meetings are useful and productive," the   UNSC  said in the statement.   India has repeatedly criticised the Security Council over the lack of accountability and transparency in the framing of peacekeeping mandates and has said that this "failing" by the world body is resulting in rising casualties among peacekeepers and civilians.   India's Permanent Representative to the UN Asoke Mukerji, who retired last month, has said at various UN fora that the Security Council must consult troop contributing countries before drawing up peacekeeping mandates given that troops now have to function is increasingly difficult and hostile conflict situations across the world's hot-spots.   Mukerji had said that Article 44 of the UN Charter clearly calls on the Security Council to invite Member States not represented in the Council to participate in the decisions of the Security Council concerning the employment of contingents of that Member's armed forces but lamented that "this hardly ever happens in actual practice".   He had stressed that troop and police contributing countries can play a role in assisting the Council to determine the kind and number of troops required for the proposed mandate, the nature of equipment required, and the costs of operating in the specific terrain of the theatre of operations.   India is the largest cumulative troop contributor to UN peace operations, with over 185,000 troops having served in 48 of the 69 missions mandated so far.   Issuing the presidential statement, the Council noted, in particular, the view of the High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations and the Secretary-General that the lack of effective dialogue among those stakeholders had generated frustration on all sides and undermined mandate implementation.   Further, the Council recognised that those consultations failed to reach their full potential despite the existence of many mechanisms, such as the Working Group, formal and informal dialogues, the General Assembly's Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, and the Military Staff Committee.   The UNSC also acknowledged that those consultations must extend beyond the issue of operational mandates to areas such as safety and security of peacekeepers, strategic force generation, gender, conduct and discipline, including allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse, implementation of protection of civilian mandates, capability, performance, equipment and national caveats.   It strongly encouraged the Secretariat to consult with troop and police contributing countries when planning any change in military tasks, mission-specific rules of engagement, concept of operations or command and control structure or early peacebuilding.   The Council called on the Secretary-General to ensure that heads of mission, force commanders and police commissioners engage with senior civilian and military staff on changes to a mandate, in advance of the issuance of a new concept of operations and directives.

Violators of odd-even rules offered roses by volunteersNEW DELHI: 'Gandhigiri' was on display at 200 locations in the city with   civil defence  volunteers offering roses to those violating odd-even rules implemented for 15 days from today to bring down pollution level in the national capital.     Delhi government  has deployed around 10,000 volunteers with rose stems in their hands across the national capital to request violators to follow odd-even rules, following the "Gandhigiri" route.   An official said that around 200 volunteers have been deployed along with traffic cops and sub-divisional magistrates in each assembly segment of the national capital at major red rights.   "There are nine districts in Delhi and each district administration has bought roses stems on its own. The flower have been given for civil defence volunteers who will offer the same to those violating the odd-even rules," said a senior government official.   The official said that most people, who wanted to ply their vehicles on even-numbered car today, relented when they were greeted with roses.   Civil defence volunteers stand at traffic halts and they also made violators of   odd-even scheme  understand the impact of pollution on them and their children.   The ambitious odd-even scheme, a first such intervention in the country to combat spiraling   air pollution , got off to a decent start on new year with volume of cars on the city roads coming down significantly amid deployment of thousands of policemen and and moderately augmented public transport.   As the clock struck eight this morning, the vehicular restriction policy came into effect with thousands of volunteers carrying roses also taking to the streets to assist traffic police in enforcing the pilot plan that will stay in force till January 15.

Pollution live meters installed at six places in DelhiNEW DELHI:   Pollution    live  meters were installed at six locations in   Delhi  for monitoring real-time   air quality  as the Delhi government's ambitious odd-even scheme to combat spiraling air pollution in the national capital came into effect today.   Besides, a portable air monitoring station was deployed in the city for air quality assessment.   "Pollution live meters have been installed at six locations in Delhi for monitoring real-time air quality as the odd-even scheme was implemented," said a senior Delhi government official.   The meters displayed real-time values of the particulate matter (PM2.5) and particulate matter (PM 10) in air.   As the clock ticked 8 AM, the odd-even vehicle rationing policy of the Delhi government came into effect with thousands of volunteers assisting traffic police in enforcing the pilot plan that will stay in force till January 15.   The scheme allows odd and even-numbered private vehicles to ply on the city's roads on alternate days. pollution,meter,live,Delhi,air qualityBesides, a portable air monitoring station was deployed in the city for air quality assessment.

Pak. Army chief confirms death sentence to 9Nine “hardcore terrorists” are set to be hanged in Pakistan after the Army chief on Friday confirmed the death sentences handed down to them by military courts for terror-related offences, including sectarian killings and an attack on ISI headquarters in Multan. Pakistan Army chief General Raheel Sharif confirmed the death sentences of nine men convicted by military courts, an Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) statement said, three days after Pakistan executed four militants involved in suicide bombing, slaughtering of people and attacks on soldiers.  The men termed as “hardcore terrorists” by ISPR, were sentenced for offences relating to terrorism, including an attack on the Parade Lane mosque, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Headquarters in Multan, attacks on law enforcement agencies (LEAs) and kidnapping and murder of civilians in Lahore. Those whose death sentences have been confirmed included Muhammad Ghauri, Abdul Qayyum and Aksan Mehboob. Ghauri, an active member of Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), was involved in the attack on Parade Lane Mosque, Rawalpindi, in which 38 people were killed and 57 injured.

Less traffic a relief but problems galore for daily commuters  Delhi Government’s ambitious odd-even scheme to curb pollution in the national capital that was rolled out on January 1 garnered mixed response from the commuters with some of them lauding it for the “futuristic approach” and a few dubbing it “impractical“. “It is definitely difficult to begin with. Someone who has driven down to office for few years can’t easily get used to travelling by metro or public buses instantly. But considering the congestion and increasing pollution, I believe this is a futuristic approach which was urgently needed at the moment,” said Gyanatosh Jha, a marketing professional. Rafeeq, a taxi driver, said that his passengers were happy to see less traffic. “The tourists are at ease today. Otherwise they always criticise the traffic system and long jams in Delhi. I have been driving taxi for 15 years and congestion has been a major problem. I believe it is good step by the government,” he said. Advocating exemption for medical professionals under the scheme, a doctor said, “I have two cars which are both odd so that means I work just half a week or I take cabs. Now I cannot predict emergency, the most essential service as far as Delhi is concerned is the medical force and we are not exempted under the scheme.”  “I think the idea is good but I will request the Chief Minister to relook at the modalities. A lot of us are in intensive care practice and they should look at it sensitively,” he added.

Police step up vigil against MaoistsThe law enforcing agencies are on high alert in the wake of forays being made by Maoists in the State, and in Vijayawada. Though the police said that the situation was not alarming, they took serious cognisance of a letter purportedly released by the CPI (Maoist) threatening that it would punish the call money-sex racketeers in a . They are on look out for the person who dropped the threatening letter at the time offices of print and electronic media. The police initially asserted that the letter was indeed a “fake one”. They averred that there was no CPI (Maoist) Andhra Pradesh Committee. But, a top cop on Thursday agreed that the Andhra Pradesh Committee did exist in the State. But, their activities were limited. The letter seems to be a desperate attempt to prove that they (Maoists) exist in the State. It could also be an attempt for extortion, felt a senior police officer. The top cop negated with the arguments that the letter did not originate from Maoists as it targeted only the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leaders while many leaders from other parties were also allegedly involved in call money episode. They (Maoists) generally target the ruling party. Their ideology was anti-establishment. So, there was nothing surprising if they had left out Opposition party names, he elucidated. The State police found that the Maoist activities were going on four districts that are located on borders of other States. Following suggestion from the police department, the government sanctioned Chintoor Sub Division to tackle the extremist activities. Merger of seven mandals from Khammam district of Telangana State with East and West Godavari districts in Andhra Pradesh has apparently spurted the extremist activities as “there is no vigil.” The Telangana State abruptly withdrew the forces from those mandals. And this came in handy for the extremist forces. The TS police decision was detrimental for Telangana also as it would help the extremists in recouping, the police officer said. The police arrested 96 extremists in 2015 and seized 27 weapons. The Maoists committed 24 offences, including murder of four civilians. These offences took place in Visakhapatnam and East Godavari districts. Two Maoists were killed in 13 exchanges of fire in 2015. “The letter seems to be a desperate attempt to prove that they (Maoists) exist in the State. It could also be an attempt for extortion.”The law enforcing agencies are on high alert in the wake of forays being made by Maoists in the State, and in Vijayawada.

Strengthening tiesPrime Minister Narendra Modi’s Christmas Day visit to Pakistan, ostensibly to wish his counterpart Nawaz Sharif on his birthday, appears to have struck a deep chord across the border (“ ”, Dec.31). It is a gesture that could go a long way in creating an enduring relationship between the two countries. However it has to be understood that India has never been found wanting as far as extending friendly gestures are concerned; it is Pakistan’s total lack of reciprocation that has allowed problems to fester as Islamabad’s attitude is like someone extending a clenched fist when greeted. After the hype, Pakistan needs to act and create a platform where all issues can be discussed threadbare.      Calibrating an effective Pakistan policy has been an issue every Indian government has had to grapple with. The Modi government seems to be carrying out diplomacy through stealth where the focus is on the results and not the process itself. Only time will tell whether Mr. Modi’s ‘dropping in’ was a masterstroke or a misstep.     Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Christmas Day visit to Pakistan, ostensibly to wish his counterpart Nawaz Sharif on his birthday, appears to have struck a deep chord across the border (“A welcome’s h
Narendra Modi’s straight road to LahoreImagine the scene: a buoyant Prime Minister Narendra Modi getting into his car after his speech in the Afghan Parliament, which India built, the ultimate symbol of the triumph of democracy over centuries of internecine warfare. In his less-than-35-minute speech he urged the Taliban to join the peace process, and Pakistan and Iran to unite in trust and cooperation, saying India was there to contribute not compete — and was applauded no less than 62 times, more applause than speech. It left Afghan elders teary eyed. That is when Mr. Modi asks for his mobile phone and makes the call to Nawaz Sharif. The call is a brief one and Mr. Modi is easily persuaded to make an impromptu decision that will lead to an astonishing sub-continental moment of sorts. By the time call is over, the cavalcade reaches its next pit stop. That is when the entourage knows where it is going that afternoon and why it is going there, and a scramble ensues to see if there is anything in the plane that could be given as gift to the Prime Minister’s sudden hosts. The search yields nothing worthwhile, leaving it to the mandarins to figure out what to send through appropriate channels later. It is an empty-handed visit yet both Prime Ministers are bearing heavy invisible gifts in a journey without maps. Soon after the  on the tarmac, and Prime Minister Sharif leads Prime Minister Modi into a helicopter for a 15-minute ride to his homestead, the message is somewhat deeper than the medium that conveys it. Imagine the Pakistani Prime Minister setting aside more than four hours on one of the busiest days of his life, a day in which he was to preside over the marriage of his granddaughter, to chaperone instead the Prime Minister of India for a quasi-summit without outcome, where no joint statement would be forthcoming as markers for the future. He remarks as much to his guest: that he has staked his political future on this new engagement with India. Equally on display is the Prime Minister’s ability to grasp the nettle. By touching the feet of Mr. Sharif’s mother he conveys something to Pakistan no joint statement ever can: here is a nationalist prime minister of India in a humanising scene. What explains this new bonhomie? Does this have a future? Is this process durable? How do we guard against surprises? Answers lie partly in Mr. Modi’s character. He is flinty in his persistence. As this newspaper has reported, he has cold-called Mr. Sharif repeatedly, almost badgering him with his Modi-style outreach. Everything seemed to finally fall into place in Bangkok, where over four hours the National Security Advisers (NSA) met along with the Foreign Secretaries and a core team of strategists, a meeting that came through backchannel efforts. It was an India-Pakistan meeting like none other. Here was Lt.-Gen. (retd.) Naseer Khan Janjua, a representative of the Deep State, who had served in Swat, Balochistan, Quetta and as head of the National Defence University, and a former spymaster, known in Pakistan as Ajit “Devil”, in a situation where no arguments are traded. With India’s counterterrorism point person, former director, Intelligence Bureau, Asif Ibrahim, on the table, the Indian side objectively laid out its concerns and expectations “more in practical security terms and less in diplomatic terms”. Mr. Janjua responded positively, saying “the past is past” and Islamabad’s intention was to “move forward”. That meeting apparently established the basis to work together, a template of sorts, defining both the steps and the goals. The underpinnings: the NSA-level talks which Mr. Sharif has long been pushing and which was not finding takers in the previous government in Delhi, would bring the talks closer to the centres of power both in Islamabad and Delhi, and provide a surer way of testing intentions. Mr. Janjua and Mr. Doval were agreed in Bangkok that it would not be difficult to assess the intentions of the other. Given the devices at their disposal, the deployments, the continuous monitoring, it would be easy enough to determine if adequate efforts are being made to curtail or stop infiltration and disrupt communications among the terrorists, for example, or even maintain peace and tranquillity along the gun embankments on the LoC. The question of what Pakistan does to dismantle the infrastructure or put it out of business comes later, much later. After the Bangkok talks, for instance, there have been no reports about firing along the Line of Control (LoC). Thus about a week after the principles of the engagement were in place, Mr. Modi was telling the Combined Commanders’ Conference aboard INS Vikramaditya that India was engaging Pakistan to “try to turn the course of history… There are many challenges and barriers on the path. But the effort is worth it, because the peace dividends are huge and the future of our children is at stake. We will test their intentions to define the path ahead”. It was a speech the significance of which was to be underlined at Lahore, the path to which was defined at the Afghan Parliament as well. There is a larger context: in the past, backchannels have brought a broad-contour understanding between the two countries on a comprehensive outcome that both sides were privately more or less comfortable with. The lack of outcome is a factor of the wild card which makes its way onto the table in unpredictable ways. This engagement comes as the Obama administration wanes, the West’s engagement with Iran changes for the positive, West Asia remains in turmoil, Afghanistan readies to engage more with us both on security issues as well as economic aspects, and the Chinese footprint deepens in the region. If India were to retain a leadership role in the region, can it be done without addressing Pakistan?Narendra Modi, Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif,World, Pakistan, diplomacy, India-PakistanImagine the scene: a buoyant Prime Minister Narendra Modi getting into his car after his speech in the Afghan Parliament, which India built, the ultimate symbol of the triumph of democracy over centur
NDRF packs more punch this yearThis year, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) not only added two battalions to its manpower but also made giant strides to enhance its technical capabilities. At a press conference held at the force’s new headquarters in the CGO Complex on Wednesday, Director General O.P. Singh said that the amount of money spent on technical equipment used in disaster response, as well as the number of such equipment procured, had gone up three times in the ongoing financial year as compared to 2014-15. In 2014-15, the force procured seven gadgets at an expenditure of Rs. 14.3 crore, while in 2015-16 the NDRF spent Rs. 42 crore on 21 gadgets. Some of the state-of-the-art gadgets procured this year include new hand-held see-through wall detectors, which will allow NDRF personnel to detect a trapped earthquake victim 20 metres below the rubble. Mr. Singh said that some of the procurement was the outcome of feedback from the force’s experience while trying to rescue victims of earthquakes, landslides and urban floods. The national Capital, in fact, is in an active seismic zone and felt several tremors this year. “We are learning a lot from disasters and are trying to prepare ourselves better. For instance, after the Nepal rescue operations we also felt the need for better communication devices which we have procured this year,” he said. Among the communication devices procured is the hand-held Quick Deployable Antennas (QDAs) on which quick and smooth voice and data can be sent to help victims in disaster zones. Mr. Singh added that his force plans to keep upgrading itself and had sent proposals worth Rs. 58 crore to the Centre for more gadgets. These proposed gadgets include like snake-eye camera, which will slip into cervices in case of earthquakes, LED balloon lights to illuminate areas where electricity supply is low and deep penetration ground-sensing radars.At a press conference held at the force’s new headquarters in the CGO Complex on Wednesday, Director General O.P.

Court notice to governmentEngineers of Bidar district administration have abandoned plans of extending an arterial road on a defence land here, after the High Court of Karnataka stayed prohibitory orders issued by the Assistant Commissioner under Section 133 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Work on asphalting the road continued under the railway underbridge, though it remained restricted to revenue land abutting the IAF campus on Chidri Ring Road. The road under the underbridge is open for traffic now. However, commuters have to negotiate a steep, 90-degree curve to avoid moving on the defence land. On Tuesday, a Vacation Bench of the High Court, headed by Justice B. Manohar, stayed the order after hearing a petition filed by IAF officials. The order of the sub-divisional magistrate on December 23 prohibited anyone from intervening in the road work connecting Chidri Ring Road and Shiva Nagar. The petitioners argued that the land was prime defence land of A category that was under active occupation. It housed the wireless signal centre that was the hub of sensitive communication considered important for national security. There is a need to restrict construction within 100-900 metres area outside such sensitive establishments as per Sections 3 and 7 of The Works of Defence Act 1903. The district administration’s order was applicable to revenue land and not to defence land. IAF officials in Bidar have handed over the copies of the orders to the district administration, the police and Public Works Department officials. “The court has stayed the magisterial order for eight weeks and issued notices to the district administration and other agencies. We are drafting a response,” sources in the Deputy Commissioner’s office said.There is a need to restrict construction within 100-900 metres area outside such sensitive establishments as per Sections 3 and 7 of The Works of Defence Act 1903.

Vigilance trains its guns on check-postsA day after simultaneous surprise raids on 71 government offices across the State, the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) on Thursday trained its guns on check-posts of the excise, commercial tax and RTO check-posts. The raids, held as per instructions from VACB Director N. Shanker Reddy, began at 7 a.m. and were based on tip-offs that there would be widespread, and illegal collection of money in connection with the yearend, especially at check-posts. There was also information that goods would be brought via the check-posts with tax evasion on a large scale. According to an official press release from the VACB, widespread irregularities were spotted during the raids, including discovery and seizure of unaccounted cash. The seizures were from the Azhiyoor commercial tax check-post in Kozhikode, from where Rs.20,740 that was hidden in lunch boxes and between files was seized. Similar seizures of varying amounts were made from CT check-posts at Govindapuram in Palakkad, Gopalapuram and the Velanthavalam excise check-post as well. The raids also found that tax was being estimated at a private weigh bridge near the Amaravila check-post in Thiruvananthapuram, thereby causing financial loss to the government.

Germany says it has information Islamic State planned suicide attacks in MunichPolice in Munich warned of a “serious, imminent threat” by Islamic State group suicide bombers wanting to commit an attack on New Year’s Eve and asked people to stay away from the city’s main train station and a second train station in the city’s Pasing neighbourhood. Bavaria’s Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann told reporters at Munich’s police headquarters authorities had received information that the militant group Islamic State was behind the threat. Munich police president Hubertus Andrae said German authorities had been tipped off by a foreign intelligence service that IS was planning attacks with five to seven suicide bombers, a German news agency eported. Andrae said so far there hadn’t been any arrests. Police spokesman Werner Kraus told   that “after evaluating the situation, we started evacuating the train stations and also asked partygoers to stay away from big crowds outside.” The warning came only hours before the city rang in the New Year. Despite police warnings to stay away from big crowds, thousands of people were on the streets of Munich at midnight to welcome the New Year with fireworks.  reported massive delays in the city’s public transportation system after both train stations were quickly evacuated and trains were no longer stopped there. Cities across Europe have been on edge since a terror attack in Paris in November killed 130 people.

The authorities never reported any findings of explosives or concrete attack plans.Islamic State militants, IS militants, Munich police, threat of attack, militant attack, suicide attack on Munich,World, Germany, unrest, conflicts and warPolice in Munich warned of a “serious, imminent threat” by Islamic State group suicide bombers wanting to commit an attack on New Year’s Eve and asked people to stay away from the city’s main train st
Violent clashes at two places in KashmirSeveral youths were injured in south Kashmir on Friday as security forces broke up a group of youths who tried to raise a memorial for the slain militants, including Lashkar-e-Toiba commander Abu Qasim.  Eyewitnesses told   that some youths gathered in Pulwama district after Friday prayers and started marching towards the city centre to erect a memorial for the militants killed in 2015. The security forces chased them away. From three sides, the protesters hurled stones at the security forces, who fired pellet guns and tear-gas shells. “Youths received pellets in limbs and abdomen,” an eyewitness said on the phone. However, there was no official confirmation. Large parts of Pulwama shut down against the killing of two militants, including a local, in a gunfight on Wednesday night. Hurriyat faction chairman Syed Ali Geelani had called upon his supporters to register their protest after Friday prayers against the killing of civilians by Village Defence Committee members.  Tension prevailed in the old parts of Srinagar when youths clashed with the security forces. They unfurled the flags of Pakistan and the Islamic State (IS) near the Jamia Masjid, a bastion of Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq. Scores of youths, including minors, threw stones at the security forces, who responded with pepper grenades and tear-gas shells. Earlier, in his sermon, the Mirwaiz hoped 2016 would foster an atmosphere of better relations between India and Pakistan. “The two nuclear-powered neighbours have no other option but to find a long-lasting solution to the Kashmir issue. This issue and not Siachen, Sir Creek or trade and travel, that has kept peace in South Asia hostage for the past seven decades,” he said.

Ganguly elected in NCC executive councilKolkata, Dec 31:Former India captain Sourav Ganguly was today elected in the executive council of the National Cricket Club (NCC) at its annual general meeting at Eden Gardens here.The executive committee will within three months’ time elect the office bearers as the former India captain may also occupy the president’s post of NCC which is lying vacant after the demise of Jagmohan Dalmiya.The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president received an overwhelming 600-plus, the maximum, votes, eminent lawyer Ushanath Banerjee, who too was elected into the 21-member executive committee, said.According to a joint statement signed by chief public prosecutor, chairman and working president Manik Bhattacharya, 614 members directly or through proxy were present in the meeting.“Meeting was extremely harmonious and cordial, we have some highly experienced members in the committee which will elect the office bearers in three months’ time,” another executive member Avishek Dalmiya, who is also the CAB joint-secretary said.Earlier, a revolting NCC group had claimed gross irregularities in the AGM and moved city civil court.Countering the charges, eminent lawyer Ushanath Banerjee termed it a gimmick with the sole vested interest of getting a few posts and tickets.“They’re wanting posts. Many of us have received a lot of phone calls, saying ‘get us just six posts and it will be the end of matter’,” Banerjee said.Asked about the allegation that notices were sent to a few members without the signature of the secretary which is a must, he said: “It is not needed as per law.”“For example, if a company has one lakh shareholders, is a signed notice sent to all of them? It’s a wrong interpretation of the Article. There’s no provision of a signature under Article 76,” he pointed out.He further challenged the claims that the AGM was held for the first time in 30 years.“It’s a wild allegation. Is everyone sleeping under ROC. Under the law you have to file. It’s a story. You can verify from ROC. This is gimmick. They’re interested in certain posts and tickets, nothing else. We’re not aware of any legal matter involving NCC. It’s a mistake that the said ‘case’ would be heard on January 2.

 (Repeating after dropping a para after 8th para) : PTI feed, News - India TodayTerrorists target IAF base; 3 securitymen, 5 attackers killed  From Anil Bhat  Pathankot (Punjab), Jan 2 (PTI) Heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists today attempted to storm the Air Force base here, triggering a day-long gunbattle in which three securitymen and all the five infiltrators were killed, days after Prime Minister  Narendra Modi s surprise stopover in Lahore.  With the obvious intention of destroying fighter jets and attack helicopters housed there, the group of terrorists in army fatigues attempted to storm the base which is barely 35 kms from the international border with Pakistan but failed to go beyond the outer periphery.  In heavy exchange of fire, a commando and two other personnel of the IAF were killed along with all the five attackers. At least, six security men were also injured.  "I congratulate our armed forces and other security forces on successfully neutralising all the five terrorists in Pathankot Operation," Home Minister  Rajnath Singh  tweeted after about 16-hour-long operation.  Home Ministry sources said Singh tweeted after receipt of information that the operation was over.  The Prime Minister, who had taken a big political risk by going to Lahore, said in Mysuru that the attack was carried out by "enemies of humanity who cant see India progress".  He expressed pride in the security forces, saying they did not let the terrorists succeed.  The attackers were believed to have infiltrated from Pakistan and there was speculation that they may belong to Jaish-e-Mohammad headed Maulana Masood Azhar of the Kandahar hijack episode.  The terrorists, who are said to have infiltrated three days ago, launched the first ever attack on an Indian Air base at around 3.30 am, their obvious targets being MiG-21 fighter aircraft and MI-25 attack helicopters.  Rajnath Singh did not rule out the possibility of involvement of Pakistan-based JeM terror outfit in the attack.  "The case will be probed by the NIA but the possibility of JeM being behind the attack cannot be ruled out," he said.  In the wake of the attack, Defence Minister  Manohar Parrikar  cut short his stay in Goa and returned to Delhi where he held a high level meeting which was attended by National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and three Service chiefs.  "Through timely and prompt action by all agencies, the likely plan of the terrorists to destroy valuable assets of the Air Force has been foiled," IAF said in a statement after the meeting.  The terrorists could not go beyond the langar (eating place) near the outer perimeter of the IAF complex as the security forces were ready to take them on, officials said about the operation which was supervised directly by Doval.

Pak number used to hire taxi by terrorists in Pathankot : India, News - India TodayThe terrorists, who carried out the attack in Pathankot, were in regular touch with their Pakistani handlers, who even arranged a taxi for them by calling from a mobile number of that country.  Sources said the terrorists had first used a Toyota Innova vehicle yesterday and it has been found that the driver was called from a Pakistan number.  Security agencies are questioning the driver and trying to find out whether he (driver) had been offering regular services to Pakistan-based smugglers, who have links with the terrorists, or was it a case of him not realising that it was a Pakistan number.  The driver of the Innova was called to a particular spot near Pathankot where the terrorists boarded the vehicle.  The sources said that the car was used for travelling on an untarred road and dumped after a while as the rim of the vehicle got damaged.  The terrorist then hijacked an SUV (Mahindra SUV X500) in which a Superintendent of Punjab Police was travelling along with a friend and a cook.  The SP and the cook were forced to leave the vehicle while the friend, a jeweller, was taken as hostage.  The terrorists snatched a mobile phone from them and used it to dial the number in Pakistan which was used to call the driver of the Toyota Innova. From this number, they had called their handlers thrice and once to a family member who was told that they were on a suicide mission.  Security agencies have found that from the Pakistani mobile number, the handlers were actively giving the directions to the terrorists.  Since the Pakistani number was under surveillance, security agencies were able to find out the possible target of the terrorists, leading to dispatching of 160 NSG commandos, army special forces besides others.

Successful even on Day 2: Delhi govt : PTI feed, News - India TodayNew Delhi, Jan 2 (PTI) The second day of the odd-even vehicular restriction trial, termed as "successful" by the Delhi government, saw Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia cycle to office, roll out of even-numbered cars on the citys streets and a marginal jump in the number of prosecutions.  The impact of the restrictions was not immediately reflected in the levels of suspended particulate matter which remained on the higher side keeping the average air quality very poor.  Transport Minister Gopal Rai took a bus ride to take stock of the situation and spoke to volunteers deployed on the roads tasked with handing over roses to errant motorists. "Two days trials show that people of Delhi are ready for it," he said.  Across the city, including at major arteries in central Delhi, traffic police were seen stopping violators. A total of 276 violators were challaned by traffic and the citys transport department as opposed to yesterdays 203.  The unprecedented restrictive measures, aimed at curbing pollution, was rolled out in the city yesterday that led to a major cut in the number of cars on city roads.  Sisodia, whose car bears an odd registration number, cycled to the All India Radio office at 8.30 AM from his residence and then pedalled down to Delhi Secretariat after taking part in a radio show there.  A thousand more traffic police personnel were deployed today even as more volunteers came out in the streets encouraging Delhiites to support ambitious drive to curb air pollution and vehicular congestion in the city.  The traffic flow which was relatively less in the morning increased noon onwards with volunteers on roads ensuring plying of even cars.  "1000 more officials were deployed today because the traffic police could not operate at its optimum capacity yesterday, as large number of police officials were deployed on the road till 3 AM on the intervening night of new year," a senior police official said.  While the school children who took the awareness campaign lead yesterday, were not seen today, more civil defence volunteers were seen on busy stretches holding posters and guiding the public to abide by the rules.  The real test for the scheme will be on Monday, the first working day of the week with several offices and courts opening after new year and week-end holidays.PTI VIT GJS SBR VMNtraffic police,odd-even vehicular restriction,Manish Sisodia cycle,average air quality,Minister Gopal Rai,unprecedented restrictive measures,traffic police personnel,GJS SBR VMN,week-end holidays.PTI VIT,odd registration numberSuccessful even on Day 2: Delhi govt

"Through timely and prompt action by all agencies, the likely plan of the terrorists to destroy valuable assets of the Air Force has been foiled," IAF said in a statement after the meeting.  The terrorists could not go beyond the langar (eating place) near the outer perimeter of the IAF complex as the security forces were ready to take them on, officials said about the operation which was supervised directly by the NSA.  Initially, it was estimated that four terrorists were involved, with a top Punjab Police official announcing the end of the operation after killing of four attackers.  However, after a brief lull, sounds of gunshots and blasts were again heard as the security forces started a combing operation. The security establishment had anticipated a terror attack after some armed men abducted an SP of Punjab Police on Thursday night and as a result a team of NSG commandos had been rushed here last night itself after the NSA held a series of meetings with the Army Chief and top IB officials yesterday. Two columns of army (comprising about 50 men) were also positioned at the Air base, officials said.  "Intelligence inputs had been available of a likely attempt by terrorists to infiltrate into the military installation in Pathankot area. In response, preparatory actions had been taken by the Indian Air Force to thwart any such attempt," the IAF statement said.  "Due to the effective preparation and coordinated efforts by all the security agencies a group of terrorists were detected by the aerial surveillance platforms as soon as they entered the Air Force Station at Pathankot," it added.  The Air Force said "The infiltrators were immediately engaged and contained within a limited area, thus preventing them from entering the Technical zone where high value assets are parked."  IAF was using its two attack helicopters to assist the joint team of ground troops to neutralise the remaining terrorists, the sources said.  The terrorists, with huge quantity of RDX in their possession, made their way to the base from the back side where there is a jungle, they said.

Govt needs to reassess nature of engagement with Pak: Cong : PTI feed, News - India TodayPathankot, Jan 2 (PTI) Congress leader Ashwani Kumar today said the Prime Minister and Central government will have to reassess the direction and nature of engagement with Pakistan in the light of ground realities after armed Pak terrorists struck at an Air Force base in a pre-dawn attack.  Kumar, who visited the post here amid anti-Pak protests, said the gaps, if any, in intelligence and security apparatus need to be filled as the attack could not be foiled despite reported information with agencies about it.  The former Union Minister also said Congress, which condemns the dastardly attack, stood united in fighting terror and fully backs the government and armed forces fighting against terrorism.

"Peace is the dividend of power and not of weaknesses," he said.  Concerned over the role of intelligence agencies, he said, "Sources say that the Intelligence Bureau had information 48 hours ago that there is a possibility of an attack.  "That is what we are told. Yet we could not foil this attack. Therefore, we need to fill-in, in case there are any gaps in the intelligence and security apparatus."

Kumar lamented that the attacks, which have boosted the morale of terrorists, come within days of Prime Minister returning after a visit to Pakistan.

Army had positioned two columns (comprising about 50 men) and a team of Special Forces at the Pathankot Air Force station prior to the attack, defence sources said.  Punjab police had also been put on alert and Additional DGP had been positioned in Pathankot to oversee the security situation, the sources said.   Army, Air Force personnel, Helicopters, NSG commandos and SWAT teams had been engaged to counter the militants in the coordinated counter operation, police said.

They had slit the throat of the SPs friend Rajesh.  Those who attacked Salwinder Singh had also taken away his phone and used it suspectedly for making calls to Pakistan.   A team of National Investigation Agency (NIA), mandated to probe terror cases, today reached Pathankot IAF base to gather inputs about the attack.    In the wake of the attack, Punjab has been put on maximum alert while security measures were also tightened in neighbouring Haryana and common capital of the two states-- Chandigarh and Himachal Pradesh, official sources said.

Terror strike at IAF base; 3 securitymen, 4 attackers killed : PTI feed, News - India TodayFrom Anil Bhat  Pathankot (Punjab), Jan 2 (PTI) Heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists today attempted to storm the Air Force base here, triggering a day-long gunbattle in which three securitymen and four infiltrators were killed, days after Prime Minister  Narendra Modi s surprise stopover in Lahore.  With the obvious intention of destroying fighter jets and attack helicopters housed there, the group of terrorists in army fatigues attempted to storm the base which is barely 35 kms from the international border with Pakistan but could not penetrate deep.  In heavy exchange of fire, a commando and two other personnel of the IAF were killed along with four attackers. At least, six security men were also injured. While high level defence sources put the number of terrorists killed at four, Home Minister  Rajnath Singh  had tweeted, "I congratulate our armed forces and other security forces on successfully neutralising all the five terrorists in Pathankot Operation. Later, the tweet was deleted.  The Prime Minister, who had taken a big political risk by going to Lahore, said in Mysuru that the attack was carried out by "enemies of humanity who cant see India progress".  He expressed pride in the security forces, saying they did not let the terrorists succeed.  The attackers were believed to have infiltrated from Pakistan and there was speculation that they may belong to Jaish-e-Mohammad headed Maulana Masood Azhar of the Kandahar hijack episode.  The terrorists, who are said to have infiltrated three days ago, launched the first ever attack on an Indian Air base at around 3.30 am, their obvious targets being MiG-21 fighter aircraft and MI-25 attack helicopters.  Rajnath Singh did not rule out the possibility of involvement of Pakistan-based JeM terror outfit in the attack.  "The case will be probed by the NIA but the possibility of JeM being behind the attack cannot be ruled out," he said.  The terrorists were carrying Under Barrel Grenade Launcher (UBGL), 52 mm mortars, AK rifles and GPS machine.  Based on intercepts, security agencies believe that one Nazeer from Bahawalpur in Pakistan was leading the group. Defence sources said the terrorists sneaked into the nearly 2000-acre air base through a forested area where were confronted by the Quick Reaction Team of Garud commandos. They managed to go up to 400 metres but were still 700 metres away from the area where fighters were stationed.  In the wake of the attack, Defence Minister  Manohar Parrikar  cut short his stay in Goa and returned to Delhi where he held a high level meeting which was attended by National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and three Service chiefs.  "Through timely and prompt action by all agencies, the likely plan of the terrorists to destroy valuable assets of the Air Force has been foiled," IAF said in a statement after the meeting.  The terrorists could not go beyond the langar (eating place) near the outer perimeter of the IAF complex as the security forces were ready to take them on, officials said about the operation which was supervised directly by Doval.

Terrorists design cant succeed in Ind: Naqvi : PTI feed, News - India TodayRampur (UP), Jan 2 (PTI) Extremists have realised that their designs would never succeed in India due to the "tough attitude" of Prime Minister  Narendra Modi  towards terror and the high morale of security forces for dealing with situations like the attack in Pathankot today, Union minister  Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi  has said.  Also, amidst speculation as to what impact the attack today would have on the peace talks between India and Pakistan, the minister spoke of the "BJP governments policy of generating, maintaining and furthering very good relationship" with the neighbouring country.  Pointing at the operation today by security forces following the terror strike in Pathankot, he said that the way the attack was "mercilessly crushed" shows that India is geared up to respond to such activities.

"Modis fear very much exists in the minds of the activists of Islamic State", Naqvi said as he claimed that the outfit tried to enter India but had to retreat due to Modis "tough attitude on this count".  The Minister of State for Minority Affairs, meanwhile, congratulated Indian Muslims for their patriotism, saying they "never lend their ear to IS and crushed those elements who tried to bring the outfit to India".  Naqvi said that the day would come when Pakistan shall be forced to hand over LeT leader Hafiz Sayeed and fugitive don Dawood Ibrahim due to the BJP governments policy of "generating, maintaining and furthering very good relationship with Pakistan".  "This gesture of ours was proved by the recent visit of the prime minister and the much-friendly meetings (sic) with his Pakistan counterpart," he said.  Turning to Samajwadi Party-ruled Uttar Pradesh, he said that "the Centre has sanctioned Rs 3,000 crore expecting that development in the real sense of the term would take place" in the state.  He further averred confidently that BJP would form the government in the state after the 2017 elections and not ally with any other party. He said the party has formulated its strategies for achieving that goal.

Noting that the PLA Army is the oldest force led and founded by the CPC, Xi praised its long history, "tremendous military exploits and immortal deeds".  "The PLA Army has played an irreplaceable role in defending national sovereignty, security and development interests," Xi said.  He called on army soldiers to embrace honourable traditions, adapt to changing situations in the digital age and explore new patterns in land battles.  The army needs to optimise its structure and composition, expedite its transformation from regional defence to universal fighting and build itself into a powerful modern land force.  A new force in safeguarding national security, the SSF represents "an important growth point" of the Chinese military in modern war, Xi said.  Xi called on the soldiers of the force to achieve leapfrogging development in key fields, set a high bar and strive to build a strong modern strategic support force.  Under the new structure of the military command system all wings of PLA will operate under a joint operational command.  China has seven military area commands - Beijing, Nanjing, Chengdu, Jinan, Shenyang, Lanzhou and Guangzhou.  Of these, Chengdu is responsible for security on the border in the Tibet region with Indias eastern sector along Arunachal Pradesh while Lanzhou partly looks after the western sector, including Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.  As per the new strategic zone plan announced by Xi, both Chengdu and Lanzhou get integrated into strategic command region making them perhaps the biggest operational areas for the Chinese military.

UK plans special force to train anti-IS fighters : PTI feed, News - India TodayFrom Aditi Khanna  London, Jan 2 (PTI) The British Army is planning a special force to train local troopsin Iraq and Syriato fight Islamic State (IS) terrorists, a media report said here today.  According to The Times, the specialised infantry battalions will also help to single out soldiers with the potential to join Britains tier-one special forces.  This could boost recruitment to the UKs Special Air Service (SAS) at a time when elite military personnel are in increasingly high demand.  The new battalions "would be doing what the American Green Berets do at the moment," a defence source told the newspaper.  The Green Berets are officially ranked as tier-two special forces in the US, beneath the Delta Force and the US Navy Seal Team Six.  They are trained to do more than just mentor and advise indigenous troops, however, so are not a direct comparison to the new British concept, which will remain within the regular armys chain of command.  The idea was revealed within the small print of a review of defence and security released at the end of November.  It will form part of Joint Force 2025 ? the future shape of Britains war-fighting military.  Army planners are working on the concept with a view to establishing the first one or two pilot battalions, each containing about 450 to 500 soldiers, in the next 18 months.  Ultimately, up to five specialised battalions could be created but the final number would depend upon demand.  At present, regular British troops and special forces are deployed around the world to train and advise local militaries.  Countries with a British army presence include Iraq, Afghanistan, Jordan, Ukraine and Nigeria.  SAS soldiers are also thought to move in and out of Syria, working alongside Kurdish forces.

Terrorists target IAF base; 3 securitymen, 5 attackers killed : PTI feed, News - India TodayFrom Anil Bhat  Pathankot (Punjab), Jan 2 (PTI) Heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists today attempted to storm the Air Force base here, triggering a day-long gunbattle in which three securitymen and all the five infiltrators were killed, days after Prime Minister  Narendra Modi s surprise stopover in Lahore.  With the obvious intention of destroying fighter jets and attack helicopters housed there, the group of terrorists in army fatigues attempted to storm the base which is barely 35 kms from the international border with Pakistan but failed to go beyond the outer periphery.  In heavy exchange of fire, a commando and two other personnel of the IAF were killed along with all the five attackers. At least, six security men were also injured.  "I congratulate our armed forces and other security forces on successfully neutralising all the five terrorists in Pathankot Operation," Home Minister  Rajnath Singh  tweeted after about 16-hour-long operation.  Home Ministry sources said Singh tweeted after receipt of information that the operation was over.  The Prime Minister, who had taken a big political risk by going to Lahore, said in Mysuru that the attack was carried out by "enemies of humanity who cant see India progress".  He expressed pride in the security forces, saying they did not let the terrorists succeed.  The attackers were believed to have infiltrated from Pakistan and there was speculation that they may belong to Jaish-e-Mohammad headed Maulana Masood Azhar of the Kandahar hijack episode.  Security personnel, which included commandos from NSG, Army and Air Force, appeared to be preparing for an extended operation as the night fell and resistance continued.  The terrorists, who are said to have infiltrated three days ago, launched the first ever attack on an Indian Air base at around 3.30 am, their obvious targets being MiG-21 fighter aircraft and MI-25 attack helicopters.  Rajnath Singh did not rule out the possibility of involvement of Pakistan-based JeM terror outfit in the attack.  "The case will be probed by the NIA but the possibility of JeM being behind the attack cannot be ruled out," he said.  In the wake of the attack, Defence Minister  Manohar Parrikar  cut short his stay in Goa and returned to Delhi where he held a high level meeting which was attended by National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and three Service chiefs.  "Through timely and prompt action by all agencies, the likely plan of the terrorists to destroy valuable assets of the Air Force has been foiled," IAF said in a statement after the meeting.  The terrorists could not go beyond the langar (eating place) near the outer perimeter of the IAF complex as the security forces were ready to take them on, officials said about the operation which was supervised directly by Doval.

The Army has deployed infantry combat vehicle (Bakhtarbahdh Gadhi) and flood light in there where the combing operation is underway in Pathankot Airbase.  The attack by terrorists, suspected to belong to Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) outfit, took place at around 3.30 am. The terrorists, with huge quantity of RDX in their possession, made their way to the base from the back side where there is a jungle.

Pakistan number used to hire taxi by terrorists The terrorists, who carried out the attack in Pathankot, were in regular touch with their Pakistani handlers, who even arranged a taxi for them by calling from a mobile number of that country. Sources said the terrorists had first used a Toyota Innova vehicle yesterday and it has been found that the driver was called from a Pakistan number. Security agencies are questioning the driver and trying to find out whether he (driver) had been offering regular services to Pakistan-based smugglers, who have links with the terrorists, or was it a case of him not realising that it was a Pakistan number. The driver of the Innova was called to a particular spot near Pathankot where the terrorists boarded the vehicle. This was the second big terror attack in Punjab in less than a year. Three terrorists had stormed a police station in Dina Nagar in Gurdaspur in July last year before being eliminated in a 12-hour gunbattle. The attack came just a week after Modi made an unscheduled visit to Pakistan and met Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif with an aim of improving ties. Terrorist calls mother and says, "I am on a suicide mission." Intelligence agencies intercepted four phone calls which were related to Pathankot terror attack. Out of the four calls, three were made the attackers to their Pakistan-based handlers. One of the terrorists called his mother in Pakistan's Punjab province to seek her blessings. Sources said the attacker asked his mother to bless him before he goes ahead with the fidayeen (suicide) mission. "Son, please have some food before you lay down your life," a woman is heard telling her terrorist son in the phone call intercepted by Indian agencies. Who said what While Home Minister  Rajnath Singh  made it clear that any terror attack on the Indian soil will be given a befitting reply, former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister  Omar Abdullah  described Pathankot attack as a first major challenge to PM Modi's Pakistan overreach. "Pakistan is our neighbour and we want peace, but any terrorist attack on India will get a befitting response. Any aggression towards us will receive a befitting reply from our side," Rajnath Singh said. After the operation ended, Rajnath congratulates armed and other security forces on successful operation. Omar Abdullah tweeted, "That was quick. Here's the first major challenge to the PM Modi's bold Pakistan gambit. From past experience I'm sure it emerge that these militants crossed over within the last few hours with the airbase as a specific target".

Pak ‘fidayeen’ in Army dress kill 1 in Punjab, hijack senior cop’s carAmritsar/Chandigarh: In an attack strikingly similar to the Gurdaspur terror strike five months ago, armed men struck at two different places in Punjab's border district of Pathankot early on Friday and killed one man. Police said that the four attackers could be fidayeen from Pakistan going by their description of one of the survivors and were on the loose in the border district.   National Security Guard commandos landed in the state by around 9.30 pm on Friday to track down the alleged terrorists, believed to be in hiding in Pathankot's hilly terrain. The India-Pakistan border has been sealed at Gurdaspur, Ferozepur and Amritsar.   Police officers found the first victim, 40-year-old Sikh man Ikaagar Singh, near Kathlor bride in Pathankot near his Innova. He was killed with a sharp weapon. The attackers also stole at gunpoint the official Mahindra XUV of Gurdaspur superintendent of police (headquarters) Salwinder Singh who was returning from Pathankot along with his cook Madan and a jeweller friend Rajesh Verma. They were stopped at Gulpur Simbli a village on the Pathankot highway, about 15 km from Kathlor.        The official police car with the beacon was found abandoned barely two km from the Tajpur air force station on the Punjab-Himachal Pradesh border. Police found three crushed cans of an energy drink and a glove near the car.   The abductors had taken Verma with them and slit his throat, but he survived and has been admitted to a hospital. It is his description that the police are using to create a picture of the attackers and track them down.   Punjab additional director general of police (ADGP), law and order, H S Dhillon who rushed to Pathankot, told TOI that the four attackers were dressed in Army fatigues, had backpacks and were armed with AK47 rifles.   "We are going more by the version of the injured person as he spent the maximum time with the attackers," he said. "The four men were talking in Urdu and Kashmiri," the officer added.   Cops believe that the attackers first carjacked Ikaagar and forced him to driver them. The car's tyre burst possibly because Ikaagar was driving rashly, so the men killed him and took the SP's car next. The attackers are believed to have forced the cop and his cook out of the car and taken Verma along. They abandoned the car about two km from the Tajpur air force station from where the men are believed to be on foot.   The cops have alerted all defence installations in the area including the air force station given that fidayeen are known to attack them first. An elaborate search operation is on in the border area with the help of all security agencies.   Border Range inspector general Lok Nath Angra said the SP and his two companions were going to a Mazar. "They overpowered the men and later slit Verma's throat."   Punjab Frontier BSF DIG Mohan Lal said that after an alert by Punjab Police, they had checked their arrangements along the border and did not have any reports of abnormal activity or breach. "Our vigil is already high since the Dinanagar terror attack," he said. In an attack strikingly similar to the Gurdaspur terror strike five months ago, armed men struck at two different places in Punjab’s border district of Pathankot early on Friday and killed one man.

There should be no talks with Pakistan, says M S Bitta : PTI feed, News - India TodayChandigarh, Jan 2 (PTI) Strongly condemning the attack by suspected Pakistani terrorists on an Air Force base in Pathankot, Chairman of the All India Anti-Terrorist Front, M S Bitta today said there should be no talks with Pakistan till cross-border terrorism is not stopped.  "It is a dastardly and a cowardly act. I am of the view that there should be no talks with Pakistan till the time  cross-border terrorism is not stopped. India should forthwith stop dialogues with Pakistan, completely seal the borders and suspend the Lahore bus, train services, and other engagements," Bitta said.  Bitta, who had survived a terrorist attack in Delhi in 1993 when he was the chief of the Youth Congress, said the timing of the attack reminded him of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees visit to Lahore when Pakistani army was planning an attack on Kargil.  "In my opinon, Prime Minister  Narendra Modi  should not have visited Pakistan, even if it was not a formal visit. I feel ISI in Pakistan is stronger than the government there. Whenever any good initiative is taken from our side, they betray us," he told PTI over phone.  "I will say that political parties will have to change their politics and put the fight against terrorism at highest priority, other things can come later. If this is not done, then no one can save this country," Bitta said.  "Terrorists dont have any religion, they are out there to destroy and kill innocent people," he stated.  He also said that Punjab now has to maintain maximum alert.  "Pakistan will try to make Punjab soft target again, we will have to be alert.I appeal to political parties in Punjab also that peace returned to the state after so much bloodshed during militancy days, lets try to save it otherwise it is on Pakistans radar and consequences can be grave," he added.  Bitta also said, "We need to strengthen our security system, like on the pattern of Gujarat, which also shares border with Pakistan".  "We should also raise peoples awareness about the threat which terrorisim poses, like the way we had done in Punjab during terrorism days. Political parties must also play a responsible role to educate people. Unfortunately, they just debate and fight on TV and the matter ends there," he said.

In response, preparatory actions had been taken by the Indian Air Force (IAF) to thwart any such attempt," it said.  IAF added that due to the effective preparation and coordinated efforts by all the security agencies a group of terrorists were detected by the aerial surveillance platforms as soon as they entered the Air Force Station at Pathankot.

Terror & talks with Pakistan cant go together, says Shiv Sena : PTI feed, News - India TodayMumbai, Jan 2 (PTI) Condemning the terror strike by Pakistani militants in Pathankot, Shiv Sena today said "terror and peace talks cant go simultaneously" as it expressed concern that the attack happened within a week of Prime Minister  Narendra Modi s unscheduled visit to Lahore.  "Whenever there is an attack on us, there is no need to say who is behind it. We can say with eyes closed that attackers are from Pakistan," Shiv Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut said here.  In a pre-dawn attack, a group of heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists, suspected to belong to Jaish-e-Mohammed outfit, struck at an Air Force base in Pathankot in Punjab. In the ensuing gunbattle, three security personnel were killed along with four attackers.  Noting that the attack took place after the PMs unscheduled stopover in Lahore last week, Raut said, "We dont want to play politics but its a fact that bilateral peace talks and terror attacks are taking place simultaneously. This wont do."  Peace talks and terror cannot go together and this has been Senas stance from the beginning, said Raut, whose party is a key ally of BJP and part of the NDA government at the Centre.  "Just saying that such attacks will invite befitting reply from India wont suffice. The Union Home Minister is a serious person and we respect him. But when will we give befitting response to Pakistan? Raut asked.  Rauts remark came in the wake of Home Minister  Rajnath Singh  saying India would hit back hard if there is any terror strike on its soil.

Fresh firing in Pathankot; IAF using attack helicopters : PTI feed, News - India TodayPathankot, Jan 2 (PTI) Fresh firing was reported here after a lull of few hours today when security forces were conducting combing operation after killing four terrorists who attacked the Air Force Base here.  The fresh firing indicated that some more terrorists could still be present in the area but Defence sources said there was no confirmation about their exact number.  There was fresh firing during combing operation, the sources said.  IAF has pressed into service two attack helicopters which are targeting the areas from where the firing is believed to be coming from, the sources said.  The security forces have deployed drones to get the exact location of the terrorists.  The Pathankot IAF facility, located near the border with Pakistan, is the base of MiG-21 fighter planes and Mi-25 attack helicopters of Air Force.

Terror strike at IAF base; 3 securitymen, 4 attackers killed : PTI feed, News - India TodayFrom Anil Bhat  Pathankot (Punjab), Jan 2 (PTI) Heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists today carried out a pre-dawn strike at the Air Force base here, triggering a fierce gunbattle in which three securitymen and four infiltrators were killed, days after Prime Minister  Narendra Modi s surprise stopover in Lahore.  With the obvious intention of destroying fighter jets and attack helicopters housed there, up to six terrorists in army fatigues attempted to storm the base which is barely 35 kms from the international border with Pakistan but failed to go beyond the outer periphery.  In heavy exchange of fire, a commando and two other personnel of the IAF were killed along with four of the attackers. Blasts and intermittent exchange of fire was continuing this evening.  There was no clarity as to the number of attackers who are believed to have infiltrated from Pakistan and there was speculation that they may belong to Jaish-e-Mohammad headed Maulana Masood Azhar of the Kandahar hijack episode.  Security personnel, which included commandos from NSG, Army and Air Force, appeared to be preparing for an extended operation as the night fell and resistance continued.  The terrorists, who are said to have infiltrated three days ago, launched the first ever attack on an Indian Air base at around 3.30 am, their obvious targets being MiG-21 fighter aircraft and MI-25 attack helicopters.  Union Home Minister  Rajnath Singh  did not rule out the possibility of involvement of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terror outfit in the attack.  "The case will be probed by the NIA but the possibility of JeM being behind the attack cannot be ruled out," he said.

Pathankot terror attack: Security beefed up in J&K : PTI feed, News - India TodayJammu, Jan 2 (PTI) In the wake of the terror attack on Pathankot air base, security in Jammu and Kashmir especially the air force installations and the Indo-Pak border has been beefed up.  "The problem is that there may not be a specific threat but the threat (of terror attack) is always there. If we see the frequency of these things happening in the past, you need to be prepared all the time," Director General of Police (DGP) J&K, K Rajendra Kumar, told PTI.  He said all the security-related measures have been put in place but there was always scope for improvement.  "We have plugged all the vulnerable infiltration routes along the border. Barricades have been put in place on the highways and checking of all the vehicles entering the state is being conducted," he said.  The DGP, who held a high-level meeting to review the security arrangements in the state following the Pathankot terror attack, also toured various border areas in Jammu district.  "I am myself touring the areas along the Indo-Pak border in Jammu region and checking our arrangements to thwart any nefarious designs of anti-national elements," the DGP said.  The top cop said that various security agencies were constantly assessing the situation in Jammu and Kashmir post the Pathankot terror attack.  "It is a continuous process and we keep on upgrading preparations. We cannot be taken by surprise that is why various security agencies have been monitoring the situation in the state," the DGP said.  All the police stations along the Jammu-Pathankot national highway and areas on the International Border (IB) have been asked to maintain extra vigil.  The quick reaction teams have also been put on stand-by whereas the number of check posts on the Jammu-Pathankot highway have been increased.  Security has also been tightened outside the Air Force stations and the Jammu and Srinagar Airports.  "Security alert has been put in place at the air force stations in Jammu, Udhampur and Awantipura while security has been tightened outside the Jammu and the Srinagar Airports," a senior army officer said.  Following the terror attack in Pathankot, the Border Security Force (BSF) which looks after the IB in Jammu has also been asked to remain extra vigilant.  "Though we maintain round the clock vigil along the IB and never let our guard down, but whenever a terror attack takes place there is always a threat that some infiltrators might try to take advantage of the situation. Hence, we have asked our men to remain extra vigilant," a senior BSF officer said.

JeM role not ruled out,India will give befitting reply:Rajnath : PTI feed, News - India TodayNew Delhi, Jan 2 (PTI) Home Minister  Rajnath Singh  today did not rule out the possibility of involvement of Pakistan- based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammad in Pathankot attack and said India would hit back hard if there is any terror strike on its soil.  "Pakistan is our neighbouring country. We want good relations with not just Pakistan but with all our neighbours. We also want peace but if there is any terror attack on India, we will give a befitting reply. We will hit hard," he said.  Asked about the possibility of JeMs involvement in the attack, Singh said such a possibility cannot be ruled out.  "The case will be probed by the NIA but the possibility of JeM being behind the attack cannot be ruled out," he said.  The Home Minister said there were intelligence inputs about possible terror attacks in Punjab and steps were taken which helped avert higher casualties.  "There were some inputs and hence there was caution. We have exercised caution. If we had not taken steps, there could have been bigger damage," he said.  The Home Minister said the operation was still on by the army and other forces to detect if any more militants were hiding.  "Operation is still on. Unless it is completed, we cant say what are the total casualties. But I think our forces are achieving success," he said.  Singh said he was happy that the security forces -- army jawans, paramilitary jawans and jawans of the Punjab police -- were giving a befitting reply.

Pathankot terror attack: Will India-Pakistan peace process be a victim again? : India, News - India TodayPrime Minister  Narendra Modi 's sudden stopover in Lahore on December 25 to meet his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif was hailed by the international community, experts and sections of the media as a giant step towards bettering ties between the two neighbouring nations. Modi was first Indian PM to touchdown on the Pakistan soil in over 10 years.  Modi is rewriting the rulebook of diplomacy, said experts. Just a week after Modi's Lahore pitstop, terror attack on Pathankot Air Force base (on January 2) has once again underlined the fact that the road to India-Pakistan peace process is not so smooth. ALSO READ | 4 militants killed in terror attack on Pathankot Air Force base, encounter ends The attack by banned terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) has come at a time when India and Pakistan have agreed to restart the composite bilateral dialogue process. During Modi's surprise Lahore visit, both sides had agreed that foreign secretaries would meet on January 14-15 to expand the horizon of peace process. Pathankot terror attack has posed fresh challenge to both India and Pakistan that such nefarious attempts by Pakistan-based terror groups do not derail the dialogue that hasn't even resumed officially. This is not for the first time that terror groups have tried to hijack the peace process between the two nuclear capable countries. They have succeeded in the past. Will it be any different this time? ALSO READ | Terror attack on Pathankot air base: What we know so far Last year in August, just weeks before the scheduled India-Pakistan NSA-level talks, terrorists had carried out attacks in Gurdaspur in Punjab and Udhampur in Jammu and Kashmir.

The nation is proud of our security and armed forces. Pakistan is our neighbour and we want peace, but any terrorist attack on India will get a befitting response. Any aggression towards us will receive a befitting reply from our side," Home Minister  Rajnath Singh  said. The pressure in now on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Focus on resolving situation, premature to say anything: MEA : PTI feed, News - India TodayNew Delhi, Jan 2 (PTI) External Affairs Ministry today said it was "premature" to say anything now given that the security operation at Pathankot, where the air base was attacked by Pakistani terrorists, was still on.  "On #PathankotAttack : Operations continuing, immediate focus on resolving situation - premature to say anything more at this point," the MEA Spokesperson tweeted.  The tweet came amidst a raging debate over the possible impact of todays terror strike on Indo-Pak dialogue which had got a fillip after a surprise visit by Prime Minister  Narendra Modi  to Lahore last week to meet his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif.  In a pre-dawn attack, a group of heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists, suspected to be belonging to Jaish-e-Mohammed outfit, struck at an Air Force base here in Punjab, leading to a fierce gunbattle in which three security personnel were killed.

Pathankot terror attack planned by ISI: The inside story : India, News - India TodayThe brazen terror attack on Pathankot Air Force base was carried out on the behest of Pakistan's intelligence agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), sources said. Here is the inside story of how the attack in which four attackers, one Air Force commando and two Defence Service Core (DSC) jawans were killed was conceived and carried out.  See pics Some senior ISI men met top leaders of banned terror groups Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Hizbul Mujahideen in December 2015. The meeting took place somewhere in Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK). ISI called for cooperation between all terror groups to carry out attacks inside India during this meeting. Six terrorists sneak into India through Gurdaspur border on December 30. Four attackers killed in gun battle with security forces. Hunt on for remaining two militants. These suicide bombers are believed to be armed heavily. The men were trained for six months at a terror camp in Bahawalpur, Pakistan. They were associated with Al-Rahman trust. They were in constant touch with their handlers Maulana Ashfaq Ahmed and Haji Abdul Shakoor ever since they entered Indian territory. The six men were tasked to destroy fighter jets stationed at Pathankot air base and inflict heavy damage.  Security forces recovered AK47s, hand grenades, GPS trackers apart from large amount of ammunition from the four killed militants. Intelligence agencies alerted security agencies about terror groups planning big attack on security installations in the country. On January 1, NSA Ajit Doval had alerted the Indian Air Force, NSG and Punjab Police about a possibility of terror attacks. Following the alert, Western Air Command chief Air Marshal SB Deo had reached Pathankot air base on Friday night itself to take stock of security preparations.

Terror strike at IAF base; 3 securitymen, 4 attackers killed : PTI feed, News - India TodayFrom Anil Bhat  Pathankot (Punjab), Jan 2 (PTI) Heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists today attempted to storm the Air Force base here, triggering a day-long gunbattle in which three securitymen and four infiltrators were killed, days after Prime Minister  Narendra Modi s surprise stopover in Lahore.  With the obvious intention of destroying fighter jets and attack helicopters housed there, the group of terrorists in army fatigues attempted to storm the base which is barely 35 kms from the international border with Pakistan but could not penetrate deep.  In heavy exchange of fire, a commando and two other personnel of the IAF were killed along with four attackers. At least, six security men were also injured. While high level defence sources put the number of terrorists killed at four, Home Minister  Rajnath Singh  had tweeted, "I congratulate our armed forces and other security forces on successfully neutralising all the five terrorists in Pathankot Operation.  The Prime Minister, who had taken a big political risk by going to Lahore, said in Mysuru that the attack was carried out by "enemies of humanity who cant see India progress".  He expressed pride in the security forces, saying they did not let the terrorists succeed.  The attackers were believed to have infiltrated from Pakistan and there was speculation that they may belong to Jaish-e-Mohammad headed Maulana Masood Azhar of the Kandahar hijack episode.  The terrorists, who are said to have infiltrated three days ago, launched the first ever attack on an Indian Air base at around 3.30 am, their obvious targets being MiG-21 fighter aircraft and MI-25 attack helicopters.  Rajnath Singh did not rule out the possibility of involvement of Pakistan-based JeM terror outfit in the attack.  "The case will be probed by the NIA but the possibility of JeM being behind the attack cannot be ruled out," he said.  The terrorists were carrying Under Barrel Grenade Launcher (UBGL), 52 mm mortars, AK rifles and GPS machine.  Based on intercepts, security agencies believe that one Nazeer from Bahawalpur in Pakistan was leading the group. Defence sources said the terrorists sneaked into the nearly 2000-acre air base through a forested area where were confronted by the Quick Reaction Team of Garud commandos. They managed to go up to 400 metres but were still 700 metres away from the area where fighters were stationed.  In the wake of the attack, Defence Minister  Manohar Parrikar  cut short his stay in Goa and returned to Delhi where he held a high level meeting which was attended by National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and three Service chiefs.  "Through timely and prompt action by all agencies, the likely plan of the terrorists to destroy valuable assets of the Air Force has been foiled," IAF said in a statement after the meeting.  The terrorists could not go beyond the langar (eating place) near the outer perimeter of the IAF complex as the security forces were ready to take them on, officials said about the operation which was supervised directly by Doval.

The Statesman: Issues with BangladeshThe India-Bangladesh Land Boundary Agreement (LBA), which was signed in 1974, eventually came into force on 1 August 2015. It provides for the formal exchange of 162 enclaves between the two countries. It is imperative to further consolidate the historical ties through functional cooperation in other spheres of mutual interest. Observers feel that bilateral economic ties continue to be hobbled, a major irritant being the illegal trade in many commodities across international borders. This has resulted in a huge loss of revenue. The smuggling of cattle persists as a border crime.   Despite the improvement of infrastructure along the borders, a lot remains to be done. The construction and improvement of Land Customs Station (LCS), the setting up of Immigration Centres and further development of the Land Port across international borders are required along with simplified procedures. Direct trade in mutually competitive commodities can eliminate the need to trade the same through a third country.  Maritime connectivity between the two countries has long been a problem area, with traders having to operate through the ports of Colombo and Singapore. The consensus reached recently on the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for operating smaller river-sea vessels between them is a path-breaking development. It is sure to give a major thrust to bilateral trade by way of reduced transportation costs and increased trade. Contextualised with the start of the Kolkata-Dhaka-Agartala bus service, this  agreement  will  further  consolidate  the  gains  made thus far.  Large vessels from the two countries have so far skirted trade through Singapore and Colombo because of marginal profit.  These are long routes, and the transportation charges and the cost of goods have only increased over the years. Economic ties have suffered owing to adverse economies of scale. The movement of cargo across the maritime expanse straddling India and Bangladesh has been impeded due to the unviable sea route. Hence, the need for such an SOP.  Hopefully, the smaller ships will directly connect India’s eastern ports with the Bangladesh ports, including Chittagong. The competitive freight rates are expected to boost bilateral trade and provide direct trade linkages rather than negotiating the same through a third country. Nevertheless, it is felt that the list of permissible commodities should be expanded to further liberate the trading potential between the two neighbours. The agreement opens new vistas in bilateral cooperation by committing both countries to accord the same treatment to the other’s vessels as done to national ones.  The other highlight of the SOP is that both countries have agreed to use what they call River Sea Vessels (RSV) for coastal shipping. With one trade barrier crossed, it becomes still more imperative to implement the MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) on the use of Mongla and Chittagong ports in Bangladesh and the dredging of intervening rivers. Trade cannot flourish if the draft in the upper reaches of the rivers is low. A positive beginning has been made but the growth of bilateral trade will depend on the follow-through which is no less critical.  A related issue is border management of common rivers and sharing of their waters, including Teesta. But Teesta water-sharing, of all issues, has eluded a solution due to domestic political constraints. Foreign policy observers feel that unless the two governments secure the interests of farmers in West Bengal, it would be difficult to reach a consensus on the issue.  Considering the menacing pace at which terrorist groups including ISIS, Al Qaida and Taliban have been spreading their tentacles, it won’t be long before they reach our shores. And Bangladesh is no less affected by terrorism. The two governments ought to coordinate their acts for wide-ranging bilateral cooperation.  Drug trafficking in the border areas finances terror groups across the world. Narco-terrorism targets the youth and weakens the societal bonding by spreading disaffection. India has succeeded in containing the menace of poppy cultivation, a major source of drug money, in its border areas but poppy cultivation in Bangladesh remains a source of worry. Given the regular movement of militants across the international borders, a reinforced extradition policy for the exchange of prisoners languishing in each others’ jails will suit the security interests of both countries. The recent extradition of Anup Chetia from Bangladesh is a positive development in this direction.  A list of prisoners was exchanged during a recent high-level meeting between the two countries. The Bangladeshi authorities handed over a list of Indians in its jails and received a list of Bangladeshi nationals in Indian correctional homes. The two countries need to coordinate their acts to forge a common strategy including coordinated sharing of intelligence to deal with such problems.  During an India-Bangladesh conclave in Siliguri in January 2015, the festering problems -including poppy cultivation, cattle smuggling and management of common rivers -were discussed. Survey, construction, repair of missing border pillars and the convening of BGB-BSF flag meetings on a regular basis were also discussed. Quarterly meetings at the level of District Magistrates are also on the anvil.  There is yet another issue that needs to be addressed by the two governments -the protection of the Sunderbans. As a natural heritage site shared by India and Bangladesh, the Sunderbans has long been awaiting a coordinated initiative to avert an ecological disaster. The rising sea level precipitated by global warming and the resultant erosion have damaged the mangroves. Experts fear that both India and Bangladesh might have to redraw their maps as they lose their lands to the sea. Consequently, the world will lose one of the largest biosphere reserves that functions as an air purifier. Apart from the looming territorial loss, thousands of people would lose their home and hearth and the Royal Bengal Tiger will face extinction. The littoral cities like Kolkata and Khulna are likely to be ravaged by frequent natural disasters including cyclones, unseasonal rain or prolonged dry spells if these mangroves continue to suffer. It is heartening that both countries have begun to coordinate their efforts to save the Sunderbans.  Towards that end, both Delhi and Dhaka have submitted their proposals at the recent climate-change summit in Paris. However, the initiative to protect the heritage mangroves rests with the local people. An inclusive and holistic approach, which addresses the ecological imperatives of the region while simultaneously protecting the inhabitants, has to be formulated.   The exchange of enclaves is only one of the many border issues that have been resolved. Not wholly unrelated is the issue of undemarcated borders. The survey, construction and repair of missing border pillars including exchange of Cadastral Survey (CS) records are some of the tasks which need to be taken up with urgent despatch. Several CS documents of Bangladesh’s Dinajpur district are in India’s South Dinajpur and some CS records of this district are in Bangladeshi Dinajpur. It is heartening to note that the two countries have been coordinating their decisions on several outstanding issues to develop dynamic bilateral cooperation on matters of mutual interest.India, Bangladesh, exchange of enclaves
The Statesman: Why did Khaleda take on history?God knows why BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia chose to make her case at this point in time. Whether it was some divine revelation or a deranged convolution or a dastardly act of political enunciation, she has recently questioned the number of people killed in 1971. What she has said isn’t half as difficult to understand as why she has said it now.  It’s not clear what political brownie points she wished to score by stirring up a hornet’s nest. How does it help, if not hurt, the shaky ground on which she stands today? How does it have anything to do with her political future if three million people were killed or not forty-five years ago? An astute politician should be more focused on mustering numbers on the streets than minding headcounts buried in the graves.  Let’s in the name of God cut her some slack and give her the benefit of doubt. Let’s say she chose to speak up for the sake of truth and unburden us of a historical blunder. But how exactly has she done it? She hasn’t given us an alternative number or explained why she has her reasons to doubt. Of course, she said that different books have given different accounts of how many people were killed by Pakistani soldiers.  But anybody who has read some of those books already knows that those aren’t scholarly works but personal accounts of people who closely watched or were close to those who closely watched the Liberation War. As a matter of fact, while so much scholarly work has been done on the history of the Liberation War, very little has been done to ascertain the number of people killed or raped during the nine months of 1971.  Nurul Qadir, who claims to have been one of the four roving ambassadors of the Bangladesh government in exile, has written a book titled Dusho Cheshotti Diney Swadhinata, the first edition of which appeared in 1997. On page 346 of this 720-page book, the author claims he was at the Indian embassy in Tehran on 5 September 1971. There he typed two letters, one addressed to the Shah of Iran and another to the Iranian Prime Minister Amir Abbas Hoveyda. In those letters, he claims, he put down “four million” as the number of people killed in the Pakistani military crackdown in Bangladesh.  Qadir confesses that he had alternately cited “four million” and “three million” at various press conferences and interviews during the war. In the eighth paragraph of that same page, he says that while he was quoting those numbers, he was thinking that 300,000 to 400,000 people were killed by the Pakistan army and their collaborators. At the bottom of the page, he eats humble pie, admitting that he didn’t know until after independence that one million was not one hundred thousand but ten hundred thousand, that also when his nephew, who had done his PhD from Singapore, explained it to him.  The tabulation of any genocide does not involve physical count alone but also certain amount of extrapolation. The death toll of the Rwandan genocide is still debated although the UN report of 1994 gives a safe range between 500,000 and one million. The American Indian genocide figures are also vague. It is believed that nearly 80 percent to 90 percent of this population died after the arrival of the Europeans.  The number of Jews killed in the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II was initially claimed as 9 million, which was revised to 4.1 million. The Auschwitz State Museum tamped down that number to one million 45 years after the Holocaust. Thus, a census of victims in a large-scale population cleansing can go wrong for a number of reasons. Flawed data collection, faulty assumptions, distorted assimilation and motivated conclusions can lead to understatement or overstatement of actual figures.  What has then prompted Khaleda Zia to unsettle settled matters? Why did she want to stir the sleeping dog of a foregone conclusion? But foregone conclusion doesn’t mean it can’t be challenged for scholarly reasons or historical correctness. It means political impulses shouldn’t dominate a matter of factual judgment, and something shouldn’t be said or done if it doesn’t clarify things for better understanding instead of creating more confusion.  As a two-and-a-bit time prime minister of the country and repository of the trust and adulation of a sizeable portion of its people, Khaleda Zia has every right to tell the truth if that truth tells something. She may or may not have some substance in what she said, but how has it improved our knowledge of 1971? She has only made her admirers more doubtful and critics more spiteful.  It was a waste of breath for her to take on history. She sounded as questionable as the history she questioned.  The Daily Star/ANN.   Khaleda Zia , BNP
The Statesman: UN to consult more with troop-contributing nationsAdmitting that its consultation process with countries contributing troops to peacekeeping operations was flawed, the UN Security Council has called for regular and broader consultations, a demand India has consistently pushed throughout last year. These developments cap the tenure of Asoke Kumar Mukerji, who is retiring as India's Permanent Representative. He had waged a constant battle to get the Council to properly consult with troop-contributing countries as it issues and monitors peacekeeping mandates.  The Council recognised that the consultation process involving it, the troop contributors and the UN Secretariat "do not meet their expectations and have yet to reach their full potential," US Permanent Representative Samantha Power, the Council President for December, said in a statement released  Thursday .  "The Security Council stresses the importance of substantive, representative and meaningful exchanges and underscores the importance of full participation by the three stakeholders so that meetings are useful and productive," Power said.  In June in one of several speeches at UN debates, on peacekeeping, Mukerji had crticised the Council saying it was "enforcing the will of a small privileged minority within the Council to look at peacekeepers as instruments to wage war." He cited its disregard of the UN Charter requirement for nations contributing troops "to participate in the decisions" of the Council on their deployment.  "India, for example, has not been so consulted," he said. "This despite the fact that India is the single largest contributor of troops to UN peacekeeping operations, having contributed more than 170,000 troops in 43 of the 69 peacekeeping operations mandated so far by the Council." India currently has 7,798 personnel serving the peacekeeping operations.  In her statement released  Thursday , Power called for extending the scope of the interactions between the Council, the Secretariat and the troop-contributors. "These consultations must extend beyond the issue of mandates of operations, and to areas such as safety and security of peacekeepers, strategic force generation, gender, conduct and discipline, including allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse, implementation of protection of civilian mandates, capability, performance, equipment and national caveat," she said.  The US role in shepherding the commitment through the Council in the waning days of 2015 during Power's presidency adds to its weight. With the US military capability overextended, President Barack Obama has in a break from the past shown interest in rejuvenating UN peacekeeping operations. He had convened an international summit on the subject in September.  The Council also recognised the troop-contributing countries' on-the-ground expertise. Power said, "The experience and expertise of troop- and police-contributing countries in theatres of operation can greatly assist the planning of operations."  India has stressed the importance of continuing consultations to make use of the reservoir of experiences peacekeepers have. During a recent interview with IANS, Mukerji gave an example of the situation in South Sudan where Indian peacekeepers are deployed. Rights to graze cattle sparked conflicts between groups and these escalated, he said. While the Indian troops on the ground, who had been trained professionally to observe the conflict environment, were aware of it, the information had no avenue to reach the Council or the higher UN echelons, thus missing an opportunity to prevent the situation from escalating, he added.  Power said the Council also asked the Secretariat to consult with troop-and police-contributing countries when planning any change in military tasks, mission-specific rules of engagement, concept of operations or command and control structure or early peacebuilding that would impact personnel, equipment, training and logistics.   This meets another of the peacekeeping issue that India has raised about the Council changing mandates midway through a mission or introducing new elements that could affect the security of peacekeepers. The Council added a so-called intervention brigade in the Democratic Republic of Congo where Indian peacekeepers are deployed. India fears that its troops could become vulnerable to attacks stemming from the aggressive tactics mandated for the intervention brigades.UN Security Council, Troops

The Statesman: Alert in Punjab after SP abducted by suspected Pakistan terroristsA high alert was sounded in Punjab on Friday after 4-5 suspected Pakistani terrorists in army uniform abducted and thrashed a Superintendent of Police and his two associates before dumping them some distance away and speeding away in his vehicle on Thursday night.  SP Salwinder Singh has claimed that he and his friend along with an employee of his were coming back after paying obeisance at Narot Jaimal Singh area last night when five men signaled them to stop, Pathankot Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) R K Bakshi said on Friday.  "As per their statement they were kidnapped and later two of them, including SP, were dumped at Tajpur village near here and third - Rajesh - was thrown out a few distance away with injury marks on his body," the SSP said.  The place of the incident is just about 15 kms from the border with Pakistan.  Salwinder said as they stopped their vehicle, all the five men barged inside the vehicle and started beating them.  He claimed that one of them took the driver's seat and drove towards Pathankot.  After a while, Singh was pushed out of the vehicle and his two companions were driven away by the men.  Later, the men pushed one person out of the vehicle near Pathankot and slit the throat of the third man, who has been identified as Rajesh Kumar, was dropped near Damtal hills on the Punjab-Himachal border after he pretended to be dead.  Police said the vehicle was recovered near Dhira village.  Inspector General (Border Range) Lok Nath Angra said high alert has been sounded and search operation was launched to apprehend the culprits.  "They could be Pakistani militants," DIG (Border range) Kunwar Vijay Partap Singh said, while informing that the assailants were four in number and wearing army uniform.  Asked about reports that the assailants had used the SP's mobile phone to make a call to Pakistan, the DIG did not rule it out.  He said the combing operation is under process in entire border area of Pathankot and Gurdaspur, where some Pakistani terrorists carried out an attack some months back.  Soon after the incident, ADG (crime) Hardip Singh Dhillon, Angra, SSP Gurdaspur Gurpreet Singh Dhillon and SSP Pathankot R P Bakhshi reached the spot with heavy police force.  Angra said the police was taking the matter seriously and investigating all angles, including possibility of involvement of militants.  Meanwhile, the body of a man, identified as Ekagar Singh, was found near the SP's abandoned vehicle at a place 35 kms from Pathankot. The body was found near Kathlore bridge, which is barely 15 kms from the border with Pakistan, police said.  It is believed that the men, who abducted the SP and two others, first snatched Ekagar's Innova who was on his way back from Kathua in Jammu and Kashmir. They slit his throat and dumped his body near the bridge before fleeing, police said.  The SUV was recovered two kms away from the body.  Villagers from the area staged a protest.  The SP's friend Rajesh Kumar was admitted to a private nursing home in Pathankot, the IG said, adding he was also being questioned.

The Statesman: Pathankot attack: Attempt to destroy assets foiledSecurity forces killed five suspected Pakistani terrorists of the outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed who had launched a terror strike on the Pathankot Indian Air Force base, near the border, ending a 15-hour gun battle. Two Indian Air Force (IAF) personnel and a commando were also killed in the attack.   Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh in a tweet said: “I congratulate our armed forces and other security forces on successfully neutralising all the five terrorists in 'Pathankot Operation'.”   Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated the security forces and said, "Enemies of humanity who can't see India progress, such elements attacked in Pathankot but our security forces did not let them succeed".  "I want to assure countrymen that our armed forces have strength to defeat evil intentions of our enemy," the prime minister added.  The Pathankot terror strike comes days ahead of a proposed meeting of the Indian and Pakistani foreign secretaries, tentatively around the middle of January, taking forward the bilateral dialogue.   The Ministry of Defence, in a statement, said it had prior intelligence inputs of a likely attempt by terrorists to infiltrate into the military installation in Pathankot area and the IAF had taken “preparatory actions” to thwart such an attempt.   The MoD said it had detected the movement of a group of terrorists by “aerial surveillance platforms” as soon as they entered the Air Force Station at Pathankot. The terrorists were immediately engaged and contained within a limited area, preventing them from entering the Technical Zone where high-value assets are parked, it said.   The MoD said that the “timely and prompt action” helped foil the likely plan of the terrorists to destroy valuable assets of the IAF.  In the wake of Pathankot terror attack Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar on Saturday held a high-level meeting with Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha, Navy chief Admiral Robin Dhowan and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval in New Delhi.   This is the second biggest terror attack in Punjab within less than a year. In July 27, 2015, terrorists from Pakistan had launched a terror attack on Dinanagar town in Punjab's Gurdaspur, leaving seven people dead, including a senior police official.   The terror attack, which is suspected to be carried out by the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed terror group, comes days after the Lahore visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the consequent warming in ties between the neighbours.   Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that while India wanted “good ties” with neighbour Pakistan, it will give a “befitting reply” to any terror attack that is carried out on its soil.   The IAF has pressed into service two attack helicopters which are targeting the areas from where the firing is coming, sources said. Security forces have also deployed drones to get the exact location of the terrorists. A National Investigation Agency team has reached the spot.   The Pathankot IAF facility, located near the border with Pakistan, is the base of MiG-21 fighter planes and Mi-25 attack helicopters of the Air Force.   There had been intelligence reports that terrorists could attack defence installations in the region around New Year. The Army had sounded an alert, and placed two Army columns and a special force team in the Pathankot base prior to the attack, an Army spokesperson in New Delhi said, agencies reported.  The technical area where MiG-21 Bison fighter aircraft and helicopters are kept was reported to be safe.   Security forces were on high alert in Pathankot in Punjab's frontier district Gurdaspur on Friday after a senior police official said he and his associates were kidnapped by five armed men in army fatigues.   Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah termed the terror attack “the first major challenge to PM Modi's bold Pakistan gambit".   "That was quick. Here's the first major challenge to the PM Modi's bold Pakistan gambit", tweeted Omar. He said Saturday'sattack shouldn't deter peace talks between India and Pakistan.   "The BJP now has to sidestep its previous "terror & talks can't go together" & insulate the Indo-Pak dialogue from such attacks," he added.   "This is part of a continuing movement by Pak to use terrorism against India," tweeted security expert Ajay Sahni.   Meanwhile, in a related development, the dismissed IAF official who was arrested for spying will be quizzed by Delhi Police in connection with the Pathankot terror attack, sources said. A court in Delhi on Saturday remanded the accused to two more days of police custody.

The Statesman: Premature to comment: MEA on Pathankot attackThe External Affairs Ministry on Saturday declined to comment on the Pathankot attack in which four suspected Pakistani terrorists were killed and said the immediate focus was on resolving the situation.  MEA spokesperson Vikas Swarup in a tweet said: “On #PathankotAttack : Operations continuing, immediate focus on resolving situation - premature to say anything more at this point.”  The attack by suspected Pakistani terrorists on the Indian Air Force base in Pathankot, north Punjab, in the early Saturday comes days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Lahore visit.  India-Pakistan relations have seen a mend in the past few weeks following a unannounced meeting between Modi and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in Paris on the sidelines of the climate summit in December.  That was followed by a meeting between the National Security Advisors and Foreign Secretaries of the two countries in Bangkok, and by External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj’s visit to Islamabad for the Heart of Asia Summit.  Both sides agreed to resume the stalled dialogue process, naming it Comprehensive Bilateral Dialogue. Modi then paid a surprise visit to Lahore on December 25,  and during the brief stopover, he visited Sharif's family and even blessed his granddaughter who was getting married that day.  The Pathankot attack is viewed as an attempt to stall the peace moves between the countries.MEA, Pathankot, attack

The Statesman: Pathankot attack linked to arrest of IAF spy?Could the terror attack on the Pathankot Indian Air Force base be linked to the arrest of ex-IAF official Ranjith KK, who was arrested from an airbase in Punjab’s Bathinda earlier this week for allegedly passing on official secrets to a suspected Pakistani intelligence operative.  Four suspected Pakistani terrorists were killed and three IAF personnel died in the attack on the Pathankot IAF base early on Saturday. Firing is continuing in the area.  Ranjith, 30, had been honey-trapped by a suspected Inter-Services Intelligence (IS) operative, Damini McNought, who posed as a journalist on Facebook and befriended the officer.  Aircraftman Ranjith was asked to give detailed information on ‘Operation Indradhanush’ and the aircraft used by the Indian Air Force in the activity.  Ranjith had joined IAF in 2010 and was posted at Bhathinda Air Force Station as Leading Air Craftsman.  A native of Kerala, Ranjith was arrested on Monday and also dismissed from service. He allegedly shared information about locations of fighter jets and Air Force bases with the ISI-backed spy through e-mails and text messages.  Bhathinda serves as a front line airbase near the Pakistan border and has a very important surveillance unit.  Ranjith had been frequently talking to Damini over WhatsApp and Viber and had passed on information in exchange for money.  Earlier, the Crime Branch had arrested five persons, including of the Border Security Force and the Rashtriya Rifles, for alleged espionage.Pathankot attack, IAF official Ranjith KK, IS
The Statesman: Security beefed up in J&KIn the wake of the terror attack on Pathankot air base, security in Jammu and Kashmir , ​   especially the air force installations and the Indo-Pak border , ​   has been beefed up.  "The problem is that there may not be a specific threat but the threat (of terror attack) is always there. If we see the frequency of these things happening in the past, you need to be prepared all the time," Director General of Police (DGP) J&K,   K Rajendra Kumar  said ​.  He said all the security-related measures have been put in place but there was always scope for improvement.  "We have plugged all the vulnerable infiltration routes along the border.

The Statesman: Odd-even: More personnel deployed on Day 2A thousand more traffic police personnel were deployed on second day of the odd-even scheme even as more volunteers came out in the streets encouraging Delhiites to support the Delhi government's ambitious drive to curb air pollution and vehicular congestion in the city.  The traffic flow which was relatively less in the morning increased noon onwards with volunteers on roads ensuring plying of even cars.

While the school children who took the awareness campaign lead yesterday, were not seen today, more civil defence volunteers were seen on busy stretches holding posters and guiding the public to abide by the rules.  "More civil defence volunteers were deployed than yesterday to educate to make the motorists aware of the road-rationing plan and its modalities," a government official said.  Carpooling and cycling were endorsed by Delhiites on social media as they posed for pictures at public hangouts like India Gate and Connaught Place on the weekend.  The odd-even vehicular restriction policy of the Delhi government came into effect yesterday with thousands of volunteers taking to the streets to assist traffic police in enforcing the pilot plan that will stay in force in the national capital till January 15.

India, Pak Exchange List Of Nuke Installations, PrisonersNew Delhi:                              India and Pakistan on Friday exchanged a list of their nuclear installations under a bilateral agreement that bars them from attacking each other's atomic facilities. The two countries also exchanged, through diplomatic channels simultaneously at New Delhi and Islamabad, the lists of nationals (including civil prisoners and fishermen) of each country lodged in their respective jails. The agreement pertaining to nuclear installations which was signed on December 31, 1988 and entered into force on January 27, 1991 entails that the two countries should inform each other of nuclear installations and facilities to be covered under the Agreement on January 1 every year.

Terror Attack At Air Force Base in Punjab's Pathankot, 2 Terrorists KilledPathankot:                              At least four terrorists launched an attack on the Indian Air Force base in Punjab's Pathankot on Saturday morning, authorities said. Two of the terrorists have been killed.   The gunfire started at around 3:30 am, authorities said, adding that an official car was used to launch the attack. The incident is being seen as connected to the hijacking of a police car a day ago.   Gunfire is being heard from inside the air base and reports suggest the terrorists have been contained in a non-operational area of the facility.   The technical area where MiG 29 fighter aircraft and helicopters are kept is safe, officials said.   The National Security Guard or the NSG has been called in, authorities said. Helicopters have also dispatched to the area for assistance in operation.   According to official sources, intelligence inputs had alerted security forces of a possible terror attack late yesterday following which the security had been increased in the area.

Want Ties With Pakistan, But Won't Tolerate Terror Attacks: Rajnath SinghNew Delhi:                              As a group of terrorists launched an attack on Pathankot air base days after India resumed talks with Pakistan, home minister Rajnath Singh said India wants good relations with neighbours but will not tolerate terror attacks. "Pakistan is our neighbouring country. We want good relations with not just Pakistan but with all our neighbours. We also want peace, but if there is any terror attack on India, we will give a befitting reply," the minister said. Around 3.30 am on Saturday, a group of suspected Pakistani terrorists attacked the air force base. Four terrorists and three soldiers have died the gun-battle that's still in progress. The attack comes days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an unscheduled stopover in Pakistan on December 25 on his way home from Afghanistan to wish his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif on his birthday. Earlier in December, India had officially resumed dialogue with Pakistan with secret talks between the two national security advisors in Bangkok. The radical away from media glare had drawn criticism from the opposition and after today's terror attack, the Congress said India should reassess its position on Pakistan. "Prime Minister Modi just returned from Pakistan after offering a hand of friendship and this is what we get in return," party's Ashwani Kumar said. Former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir Omar Abdullah tweeted, "That was quick. Here's the first major challenge to the PM Modi's bold Pakistan gambit." The People's Democratic Party, the BJP's coalition partner in Jammu and Kashmir, said "some elements in Pakistan" want to disturb the peace talks. "This particular act of terror is meant to defeat talks and ties with Pakistan. Talks can influence terror, but terror cannot influence talks," said party leader Waheed ur Rehman Para.

The Pathankot Air Base Attack: How It UnfoldedPathankot:                              The security agencies had intercepted a number of phone calls late on Friday night, which set alarm bells ringing. It appeared that a group of  terrorists were planning to launch an attack  at Punjab's  Pathankot .   Of the four calls made, three were to handlers in Pakistan, in which the terrorists reported the assault made on a senior police officer in Punjab. In the fourth, an attacker was heard calling his mother, sources said.   On Thursday, the men, dressed in army fatigues, had hijacked the official vehicle of the police officer in Pathankot.   They had assaulted the officer, pushed him off the car and took away his cellphone. Later, they used his cellphone to contact their handlers in Punjab, sources said.   The handlers were heard asking the men why they "let off" the Superintendent of Police.   Security personnel stand guard next to a barricade outside the Indian Air Force (IAF) base at Pathankot in Punjab. (Reuters Photo) The intercepts triggered a whirlwind of activity - a warning was issued and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval held a meeting with security officials. Following orders from the Prime Minister's Office, teams from the National Security Guard, Special Forces of the Indian Army and additional soldiers were moved to various installations at Pathankot.   But notwithstanding the protective measures, the terrorists struck at 3.30 am. The gunbattle, which carried on well-past mid-day claimed the lives of two Air Force personal and one Garuda commando.   Given the advanced information, the terrorists were contained within the periphery of the air base. The army's Casspir armoured personnel carriers were used to close in on the administrative block of the air base, where the terrorists were holed up.   Four terrorists have been killed in the operation.   The men, sources said, had infiltrated just hours before, sources have told NDTV. They had, in all likelihood, crossed into India from the unfenced section of the international border and proceeded towards Punjab, the sources said.

Afghan Forces Free 59 Prisoners From Taliban Jail In SouthKabul:                              Afghan special forces freed 59 prisoners from a Taliban jail in Helmand, officials said today, as government troops redouble their efforts to drive back the insurgents who have seized large parts of the volatile southern province. Islamist militants have launched a series of attacks in the capital, Kabul, in recent weeks and a tough fight is underway in key districts in the south, just as attempts have been made to revive a stalled peace process. Afghan Defence Ministry spokesman Dawlat Waziri said 37 of the captives freed from the jail, which was just to the north of the Helmand provincial capital of Lashkar Gah, were soldiers. Another seven were policemen and the rest civilians. The operation to free the prisoners followed months of fighting in which the Taliban has seized several district centres in Helmand, a major centre of opium cultivation and one of its traditional strongholds. Waziri dismissed suggestions that Helmand could fall to the Taliban entirely but said government forces faced a serious battle against insurgents who have grown in strength since foreign troops ended most combat operations a year ago. "We have to accept that there is a fight going on in Afghanistan," he told reporters in Kabul. The Helmand operation unfolded late on Friday night, just as a Taliban suicide bomber attacked a French restaurant in Kabul popular with foreigners and government officials, killing two people and wounding 18. The Taliban claimed in a statement that "dozens of foreigners" had been killed or wounded, although the Islamist group often exaggerates casualty figures in attacks on foreign or government targets. That attack, and an all-night battle at a Spanish embassy guest house in Kabul last month, highlighted the Taliban's strategy of seeking high-profile targets in the capital while at the same time stepping up its campaign to seize district centres in provinces such as Helmand. It is also a stark reminder of the difficulty Afghan officials face in their attempts to revive the stalled peace process, which broke down in July. Officials from Afghanistan, Pakistan, the United States and China are due to meet in Islamabad on January 11 to discuss how to lay the groundwork for possible talks with Taliban militants. The insurgent movement says it is not interested in new talks so long as foreign troops remain in Afghanistan.   © Thomson Reuters 2016Afghan special forces,Taliban jail in Helmand,Afghan defence ministry,Dawlat Waziri,Lashkar GahAfghan special forces freed 59 prisoners from a Taliban jail in Helmand, officials said on Saturday, as government troops redouble their efforts to drive back the insurgents who have seized large parts of the volatile southern province.

Congress 'Politicising' Pathankot Terror Attack: Prakash JavadekarNew Delhi:                              The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) today said the resumed dialogue with Pakistan cannot be revoked due to "one attack" and accused Congress of "politicising" the  Pathankot terror incident . Union Minister Prakash Javadekar batted for the continuation of talks with the neighbouring country, saying "unless you talk terror, terror will not come down". After Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Lahore initiative, the Environment Minister said the onus was on Pakistan to follow the solemn promise given to India in 2004 that it will not allow its land to be used for terrorism. "This process (talks) cannot be destroyed due to one attack... Pakistan is our neighbour. You cannot change your neighbour, you can change friends and therefore we must continue with the talks but talks have to be mainly on the issue of terrorism and that's what exactly India is doing," Mr Javadekar said. Pakistan will have to walk the talk on the issue of terrorism, he said. He supported Home Minister Rajnath Singh's assertion that India wanted friendship with Pakistan but will forcefully respond to any act of terrorism. Attacking Congress, he said it had tried to politicise the Pathankot terror incident and that was highly "condemnable". "When the whole nation is standing with the security forces, Congress is singing a different tune. It is very unfortunate and we condemn it," he said. BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli said, "This is the obvious risk of terrorism that India has borne for a very long time. We are constantly going to do our best to deal with the situation and ensure that these forces are defeated."

With Thermal Imaging, Air Force Detected Pathankot Terrorists In Pitch DarkPathankot:                              The terrorists who  infiltrated the Indian Air Force base in Pathankot  after 3 am in pitch-dark conditions were first detected by either Unmanned Aerial Vehicles or Mi-35 attack helicopters. In a statement, the Air Force has revealed that "a group of terrorists were detected by the aerial surveillance platforms as soon as they entered the Air Force Station at Pathankot". "The infiltrators were immediately engaged and contained within a limited area, thus preventing them from entering the Technical zone where high value assets are parked," the IAF said in a statement. Pathankot is known to be an Indian Air Force MiG-21 'Bison' fighter and Mi-35 attack helicopter base. Indian Armed Forces operate Israeli built Heron and Searcher Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) both of which are fitted with extremely sensitive thermal devices which can pick up the movement of infiltrators based on heat signatures that their bodies generate.   Indian Armed Forces operate Israeli built Heron and Searcher Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The air base's own Mi-35 choppers have also been upgraded with Israeli-built thermal imaging systems which can also track the movement of people even in zero light conditions. According to the Indian Air Force, the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief Western Air Command has been on-location at the air base working closely with the Army, National Security Guard and other agencies fighting the terror attack.

In the 70-second call, made at 1:58 AM, the man could be heard saying that he was out on a "suicide mission", sources told NDTV. Silence from the other end. Then he repeated, "I'm on a suicide mission and Allah will take care of all of us," sources said. In less than two hours, shots rang out at the Pathankot air base. The 10-hour gun-battle that followed claimed the lives of three Air Force Personnel. Four terrorists have been killed. The intercepted calls - made to undisclosed locations in Pakistan between 12.30 am and 2.00 am - are still being decoded. The callers spoke in Punjabi and Multani, sources have told NDTV. One of the calls -- the longest of the four -- hinted at stocktaking by handlers, sources said. In the 87-second call, the purported handlers could be heard asking, "Control mein hai (Is it under control?)". The reply was "haan (yes)". The terrorist was then asked to enter the target area. "Airforce assets, choppers aur planes ko uda do (blow up the airforce assets, choopers and planes)".   The security agencies are puzzling over a line: "Use samjhao, hame fikr hai (Explain it to him. We are concerned)". The first call, nearly one minute long, was made shortly after midnight in which three people took turns speaking with the caller from this side of the border. The location where this call was received remains undisclosed. In the second call, made around 12.52 am, a person suspected to be one of the handlers of the terrorists who carried out today's attack gave instructions to two terrorists one after another. He was brief. The call lasted 32 seconds.

Congress Targets Modi Government Over Pathankot AttackNew Delhi:                              Voicing serious concern over the terror attack on an Air Force Base in Pathankot, Congress today questioned Modi government's handling of Pakistan affairs while reminding the Prime Minister of his promise to assertively handle ties with the neighbouring country. "It's indeed a very serious matter as seven days after Prime Minister Modi visited Pakistan to meet his counterpart Nawaz Sharif, a terrorist module comes from Pakistan and attacks in Punjab and attacks our frontline security installation. Two things are very clear. First despite Prime Minister's visit to Pakistan, ISI continues to sustain and support terror activities against India. "The current module appears to have come from Pakistan in the same fashion. Secondly the terror camps that are run by terrorists for carrying on anti- India activity in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir continues to be supported by Pakistani establishments. It raises security concerns for Punjab as the state is witnessing a sudden surge in such activities after being peaceful for the last 20 years," AICC Communication department chief Randeep Surjewala told reporters. He said that the attack on the first day of the New Year in Pathankot is a matter of serious concern and the Opposition party expresses its deep concerns on this evolving situation of the internal security in the country. The BJP government should utilize the services of security experts and if necessary leaders of the Congress Party in engagement and finding lasting solution to blocking terror activity which is coming into India via Pakistan," he said. Recalling that Punjab has seen no terrorist activity for last 20 years, Mr Surjewala said, "two terrorist attacks have occurred in last 5 months, 3 terrorist attacks have been made in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab in last 5 months by terrorists who have came from Pakistan. Suspected Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists from Pakistan today struck at an Air Force base in Pathankot in Punjab, killing three security personnel while four of the attackers were killed in an operation that lasted more than five hours. The attack comes just a week after the Prime Minister made an unscheduled visit to Lahore, touching down in Pakistan for the first time on Christmas to greet Mr Sharif on his birthday and for his granddaughter's wedding. Terming the recent attack a "very serious matter", the Congress leader urged the Prime Minister to take stock of the internal security situation. "Will Prime Minister take up the issue with Pakistan, now that he has recently visited the country. How does the government propose to control and check the terror coming from Pakistan. These are important issues that the PM needs to address. Why is Punjab suddenly becoming a hotbed of such activities," Mr Surjewala said. "It is PM Modi who used to say he will show red eyes to Pakistan and then talk to them. We don't want him to show red eyes but we want him to take firm action to protect the life of citizens of this country and to ensure that our valiant security forces and our army do not lay their lives at the hands of Pakistani terror module which is continued to be exported," he said. Mr Surjewala also said that the country's intelligence agency continues to issue generalized terror threats without giving any specifics resulting in attacks where the local police and security agencies are caught unawares. "We also want the Prime Minister to ensure that the situation on the border of J&K where there have been 900 ceasefire violations by Pakistan in less than 19 months is checked and a final solution is found there too," the Congress spokesperson said. He said the entire nation stands united to fight terror. "Entire country stands united together to fight terrorism. There can be no two opinion on fighting terror among the 125 crore people of India. "We all stand behind with our security forces in this resolve," he said.

Credible Information That Pathankot Attack Hatched In Pakistan: Kiren RijijuNew Delhi:                              Government has credible information that the terror attack in Pathankot was hatched by some elements in Pakistan, Union Minister Kiren Rijiju said today. "We have credible information that this attack was sponsored by some elements across the border," Mr Rijiju, Minister of State for Home, told reporters in Delhi. Mr Rijiju said central security agencies were working in close coordination with the Punjab Police in the entire operation to eliminate the terrorists, who attacked an Indian Air Force base. In a pre-dawn attack, a group of heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists, suspected to be belonging to Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed, struck at an Air Force base in Pathankot, leading to a fierce gun-battle in which three security personnel were killed. Four attackers were also killed in the attack.

In Pathankot Attack, Security Officials See Revival Of Jaish-e-MohammedPathankot:                              With bags carrying markings of executed Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru after a recent attack near Line of Control in Kashmir and an attack at the Pathankot air base that shook the nation, Jaish-e-Mohammed -- the terror group founded by Moulana Masood Azhar -- appears to be back, sources told NDTV.   Although no official confirmation has been received from the security or intelligence agencies, sources said the attack bore indications of Jaish, the group that had been spreading terror since 2000.   Sources say the five Jaish terrorists who infiltrated the base - and were killed after a day-long gun-battle -- were launched from Bhawalpur in Pakistan, the hometown of its founder.   "It's clear this group that was lying low for last several years is back in action. The two attacks in little over a month indicate its revival," said a security official.   Police sources say although only eight to 10 Jaish terrorists are operating in Kashmir, the way it is sending terrorists for suicide missions across the border is a signal of its revival. Also, the group has always targeted the vital and strategic installations and today's attack follows that strategy.   On November 25, Jaish had carried out a suicide attack in Kashmir's Tangdhar - its first major attack in a decade.   Lt Gen Satish Dua, General Officer Commanding of 15 Corps, Srinagar, said, Jaish had claimed responsibility. "Also, the terrorists had 'Afzal Guru Squad' (named after the Parliament attack convict hanged in Delhi's Tihar jail three years ago) written on their bags," Lt Gen Dua had said.   Parliament attack mastermind Masood Azhar was released in 1999 by the government in exchange of the passengers and crew of hijacked Air India flight IC-814.   For years, he had remained confined to his home in Bhawalpur. But in 2014, in an address to his supporters, he said the time had come to "resume jihad," news agency Reuters had reported.

Terrorists attack IAF base; 3 securitymen, 4 terrorists killedPATHANKOT: In a pre-dawn attack, a group of heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists, suspected to belong to Jaish-e-Mohammed outfit, struck at an   Air Force  base here in Punjab, leading to a fierce gunbattle in which three security personnel were killed along with four attackers.    The terrorists, who struck just a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's unscheduled visit to Lahore, could not, however, penetrate the defence cordon at the Air base which is located close to the border with Pakistan as they met with effective response from the security forces, police and security officials said.    The attack by terrorists, suspected to belong to JeM outfit, took place at around 3.30 am and three security personnel, including a Garud commando of the IAF, were killed in it, defence sources said, adding four terrorists were also killed by the security forces within five hours.    But, more terrorists were suspected to be still on the loose as gunshots were heard during the subsequent combing up operation, defence sources said.    IAF was using its two attack helicopters to assist the joint team of ground troops to neutralise the remaining terrorists, the sources said.    Authorities said helicopters and other equipment at the Air base are safe. The technical area of the Air Force station is safe, police said.    The terrorists, with huge quantity of RDX in their possession, made their way to the base from the back side where there is a jungle, they said.    But they could not go beyond the 'langar' (eating place) near the outer perimeter of the IAF complex as the security forces were ready to take them on, the sources said, about the operation which was supervised directly by National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.    Anticipating an attack after some armed men abducted an SP of Punjab Police on Thursday night, a team of NSG commandos had been rushed here last night itself after the NSA held a series of meetings with the Army Chief and top IB officials yesterday. An army detachment was also positioned at the Air base, the sources said.

West Bengal came under scanner of security agencies in 2015 KOLKATA: A labourer, a couple of passport agents, a college student and a bartender were among several people arrested in   West Bengal  in 2015 for alleged links with ISI, putting the state under the scanner of security agencies as a "secure hideout" for agents of the Pakistani agency.   Fake passports, fake voter identity cards, Aadhar cards, ration cards procured from agents allegedly employed by the ISI helped these intruders getting into the country and settling here,   Kolkata  Police officials told PTI.   The state's porous international borders with Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan helped the agents to infiltrate into the country through the West Bengal, they said.   "While probing the Khagragarh blast (in Burdwan), several documents and clues indicated that those involved in the incident came from across the border of Bangladesh and they got support from locals.   "Though investigation is still on, we suspect that either they were local (agents) or the people who have settled here within a decade's time," a senior CID officer told PTI.   The arrest of a bartender in early November from central part of the city revealed that a network of ISI agents were working in the state, he said.   "We have information that there are specific roles given to each of these agents by the ISI. Some are here to recruit agents, some others are for collecting information from areas where either the Navy, Army or the Air Force have their base.   "Apart from them, there are those who are here to bring in high quality fake Indian currency notes in the country and spread them here aiming to devastate the   economy ," a top IPS officer of Kolkata Police said.   Banned organisations like the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) has spread its network in Howrah, and both North and South 24-Parganas districts, he added.   "They have set up organisational bases in districts like Murshidabad, Nadia, Burdwan and Birbhum and we are probing whether they have spread into other states like   Assam , Tripura, Meghalaya etc," the officer said.

Pathankot attack: For 24 hours, security agencies failed to trace terrorists in PunjabCHANDIGARH|PATHANKOT: Nearly 24 hours after terrorists abducted a senior police officer, security agencies in Punjab failed to trace them in the same area till they launched a terror attack on the   Pathankot  Indian Air Force (IAF) base early on Saturday.     Defence  installations elsewhere in Punjab were put on high alert on Saturday following intelligence reports that up to 15 terrorists could have infiltrated into India from Pakistan side on December 30-31.   Besides the   IAF  base in Pathankot, which was attacked by suspected Pakistani terrorists, Punjab has frontline IAF bases in Adampur (near Jalandhar), Halwara (near Ludhiana) and Bathinda and substantial army presence at various places, including Jalandhar (11 Corps), Pathankot, Amritsar, Bathinda (10 Corps) and Patiala (1st Armoured Division).   The free run that the four terrorists had for nearly 24 hours even after the abduction of Superintendent of Police Salwinder Singh on Thursday night and were able to reach and attack the IAF base, has exposed the security breach despite the high alert in the area.   The armed terrorists, who the abducted SP had told the police were in army fatigues, were able to move around in the area, probably on foot.   "The search and combing operations seemed to be casual as the terrorists could not be traced even in 24 hours. They must have moved around in rural areas and habitation near the air force station and somebody must have seen them. They could not have appeared at the IAF base gate from thin air," a former top Punjab Police officer told IANS in Chandigarh, suggesting that the revelations of the abducted SP might not have been taken "very seriously".   Salwinder Singh had had claimed that he and his associates were going in his multi-utility vehicle to a religious shrine on Thursday night when they were signalled to stop by the four men.   The incident took place near   Dinanagar  town, where three terrorists from Pakistan launched an attack in July last year. It lies about 250 km from Chandigarh.   The police officer claimed that one of the men took charge of the vehicle, which had a blue beacon on its roof, and drove towards Pathankot. After some distance, the officer was pushed out of the vehicle and the armed men took away his mobile phone.   The other two companions were also pushed out later, one after the other.   One of the two, Rajesh Kumar, was allegedly attacked by the armed men and his throat was slit. He has been admitted to a hospital in Pathankot.   The abandoned XUV was on Friday morning recovered by police near Akalgarh village near Pathankot.   Police on Friday recovered the body of the driver, Ikhraj Singh, of an Innova car, about 30 km from Pathankot.   Police was investigating if the same men, who abducted the police officer and his companions, had killed the Innova driver too.   Terrorists from Pakistan had launched a terror attack on Dinanagar town in Punjab's   Gurdaspur  district on July 27, leaving seven people dead, including a senior police officer.   The Punjab Police and security agencies were caught napping during the Dinanagar terror attack also.

Gunmen attack Indian Air Force base near Pakistan border - media | ReutersNEW DELHI  A group of gunmen attacked an Indian Air Force base early on Saturday in the northwestern state of Punjab that borders Pakistan, TV channels cited police as saying. Two of the gunmen were killed in a shootout with security forces, while two or three more were holed up in buildings on the base, Indian media reported. According to early accounts, the attack resembled a similar raid last year by gunmen on a border town in Punjab that killed nine people. India blamed that attack on assailants who had infiltrated from Pakistan.   The latest attack is likely to deal a blow to attempts to revive political dialogue between the two nuclear-armed neighbours after Indian Prime Minister  Narendra Modi  made an impromptu visit to Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif in late December.

Gunmen attack Indian Air Force base near Pakistan border | ReutersNEW DELHI  At least two gunmen and a guard were killed in an attack on an Indian Air Force base on Saturday in Pathankot in Punjab, officials said, in an apparent challenge to attempts to revive a dialogue between the nuclear-armed neighbours. Defence ministry sources said four gunmen, believed to be from Pakistan, had entered the Pathankot airbase in Punjab overnight. Two were confirmed killed in the ensuing shootout, along with the guard. The attack came a week after Indian Prime Minister  Narendra Modi  made an impromptu visit to Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif, in a bid to revive bilateral talks that had previously been derailed by militant attacks. "The moment that Modi touched down in Lahore (and probably even before), something like this was doomed to happen," said Michael Kugelman, a South Asia expert at the Wilson Center think tank in Washington.   "At this point, there's sufficient goodwill in India-Pakistan relations to weather this attack. Saboteurs won't win this one," he said. Border police chief Vijay Singh said the operation to eliminate the gunmen had lasted three hours. The airbase was being combed to determine the fate of the remaining attackers.   According to news reports, the gunmen wore army uniform.  One Indian security source blamed the attack on a Pakistan-based militant group, but said it posed no threat to civilians. The raid resembled an assault last July by gunmen on a police post in Gurdaspur that killed nine people. However, Saturday's pre-dawn attack appeared to have been much more audacious by targeting a large military facility.   One home ministry official said Punjab and Jammu states were on high alert and all defence bases had been sealed. "Attacking an air base is a serious security threat. The new strategy of the terrorists is to identify defence bases near the border and launch attacks," said the official, who was not authorised to comment on the record.

Ahead of Doval visit, Beijing says situation along Sino-India border stableNew Delhi: Ahead of NSA Ajit Doval's visit to China next week, during which he will informally discuss boundary issues with Chinese leaders, Beijing has described the situation along the Sino-India border as stable, with its defence ministry saying the two countries had dealt with the dispute "properly".   While Doval will seek to keep the focus on progress, or the lack of it, on the boundary talks? in his meetings with Chinese leaders, Beijing is expected to voice its reservations on what it sees as a more assertive position taken by India on the South China Sea disputes, as reflected in the focus on the same in PM Narendra Modi's meeting recently with his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe.   Doval will meet his counterpart and state councillor Yang Jiechi in Beijing and will also call on Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.   Chinese defence ministry spokesman Colonel Yang Yujun told reporters, "This year the border troops have maintained close exchange and through the institutionalised channels, the border defence troops of the two sides have kept in contact with each other and dealt with differences properly."   "In general the situation along the China-India border is stable," he said.   "Chinese side is ready to work with the Indian side to implement the consensus reached by the two sides and also observe the agreement signed between the two sides in border defence to jointly maintain peace and stability in the border region," he said.   While it doesn't hurt India that there has hardly been any incursion by the PLA in the past several months, Doval is expected to face some questions from the Chinese side on what Beijing sees as a more assertive position taken by India on South China Sea disputes. Beijing has already quietly expressed its reservations before Indian authorities over the mention of the dispute in the joint statement issued after the Modi-Abe meeting.   India has been consistent with its call for freedom of navigation and overflight in South China Sea, at the same time emphasizing the importance of the settlement of all disputes by peaceful means and of refraining from the threat or use of force , in accordance with ``universally recognised principles of international law, including the 1982 UNCLOS''. It also continues to reiterate the importance of an expeditious conclusion of negotiations for a Code of Conduct and full and effective implementation of the 2002 Declaration of the Code of Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea.   However, Beijing has been irked by New Delhi's decision under the Narendra Modi government to mention the dispute in bilateral documents with countries which are not directly party to the disputes. Japan is not party to the territorial disputes in South China Sea but, like in the case of India, a lot of its sea borne trade passes through the region and it also believes that checking Chinese activities in the region is necessary to maintain peace and stability in the East China Sea region. Modi's summit meeting with President Obama last year saw India and US for the first time introducing South China Sea in their joint statement. However, NSA likely to face questions on India’s position on South China Sea disputes
Achche Din: Govt’s Toshakhana receives gift articles worth Rs 57 lakh between Jan-Sept last year Toshakhana, which keeps a log of what government officials (including the prime minister and Union ministers) receive as gifts while on tour, has seen an array of exotic entries over the past one year.    Between January and September last year, the   Toshakhana  has listed 365 gift articles worth Rs 57 lakh against 295 souvenir pieces (worth Rs 23.57 lakh) received in the whole of 2014.    "We've had a lot more entries this year than in the previous years. This, partly, could be because of several overseas visits by bureaucrats and ministers," said a ministry official on conditions of anonymity.    Toshakhana, the treasure trove of the government, is governed by various 'gift acceptance policies' as also by the Central Civil Services Conduct Rules. As per a June 1978 gazette notification, every gift received by a person during an official visit should be deposited in the Toshakhana within 30 days of his return.    The Toshakhana officials are then required to assess the worth of the gift in the Indian market. The recipient can then pay the price and take the gift home. Gifts that are not valued above Rs 1,000 are returned to the recipient.    Prime Minister Modi, who has received close to 140 gift items in the first nine months of 2015, is the largest contributor to the treasure trove. External affairs minister   Sushma Swaraj  comes in the second spot receiving close to 80 gifts - mostly in the form of sarees, watches, artefacts, pens, carpets, accessories and crockery.    A jewellery box containing one necklace and a pair of earrings (valued at Rs 35 lakh) received by PM Modi is the most expensive gift in the Toshakhana. The prime minister was also gifted a 22-carat sovereign worth Rs 80,000 during one of his visits.    A   Hublot  wristwatch worth Rs 3.25 lakh, a Chanel lady watch worth Rs 3.5 lakh and an Ebel Men's sport watch worth Rs 2.5 lakh are among the other valuables gifted to Indian officials while on foreign travel. Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal   Arup Raha  was gifted two   Aigner  wristwatches bearing a combined value of Rs 1.7 lakh.    A big wall hanging, a green glazed jar valued at Rs 3,000, a carpet worth Rs 4,500, a replica of a pagoda worth Rs 1,500, a chessboard worth Rs 4,000, a pair of kurta-payjama worth Rs 2,500 and one packet of tea worth Rs 3,000 are some of the gifts taken home by the prime minister.    External affairs minister Sushma Swaraj is yet to claim her share of gifts from the Toshakhana.    Presents which are not purchased by recipients will remain at the disposal of the government. The ministry may donate   artefacts  of cultural value to public museums in the country.    Articles from the Toshakhana are also used in   Rashtrapati Bhawan , Rashtrapati Niwas (Simla), the prime minister's official residence, Indian embassies abroad and various government departments, ministry sources said.         toshakhana,Sushma Swaraj,Rashtrapati Bhawan,Hublot,Arup Raha,artefacts,AignerToshakhana, which keeps a log of what government officials receive as gifts while on tour, has seen an array of exotic entries over the past one year.

China restructures military as Xi eyes 'strong army'SHANGHAI: China has unveiled changes to the structure of its military described by President Xi Jinping as "a major policy decision to realise the Chinese dream of a strong army", state media reported.   Beijing in November said it planned sweeping changes in a move intended to enhance the ruling Communist Party's control over the People's Liberation Army (PLA).   The changes announced late Friday will see a new army unit set up to oversee China's arsenal of strategic missiles.   Besides the "Rocket Force", the PLA also unveiled an army general command to serve as the headquarters for land forces and a support unit to assist combat troops, the official Xinhua news agency said.   The changes come as China acts more aggressively in territorial disputes in the South China Sea and East China Sea and comes just after Beijing announced on Thursday it is building its second aircraft carrier.   The nation's first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, is a secondhand Soviet ship built more than 25 years ago that was commissioned by China in 2012 after extensive refits.   At the same time, Xi, who is chief of the Communist Party and also serves as head of the military, is planning to slash China's number of troops by 300,000 to roughly two million to craft a more efficient fighting force.   China's Central Military Commission, which Xi chairs, on Friday also released guidelines to help build the country's vision of a modern military before 2020 by cutting troops and improving the quality of combat personnel, Xinhua said.   The new PLA Rocket Force is tasked with maintaining conventional and nuclear weaponry with the ability to both deter and strike, Xi told a ceremony for the founding of the three new organisations, according to Xinhua.   But a spokesman for China's Ministry of Defence denied any shift in the country's nuclear weapons policy.   "China's nuclear policy and nuclear strategy are consistent, there has been no change whatsoever," spokesman Yang Yujun said Friday, according to a transcript posted on the ministry's website.   The new unit would take over from the Second Artillery Force, he said.   Beijing's forces have been involved in sometimes tense confrontations with Japanese and Philippine units over maritime disputes in the East China Sea and South China Sea respectively, prompting fears that the disputes could result in armed clashes. China has unveiled changes to the structure of its military described by President Xi Jinping as "a major policy decision to realise the Chinese dream of a strong army", state media reported.

Israel strikes Hamas sites in the Gaza Strip after rocket fireGAZA CITY (PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES): The Israeli air force carried out attacks on   Hamas  sites in the   Gaza Strip  early today, Palestinian security sources said, just hours after rockets from the enclave hit southern Israel.   According to the sources, the Israeli strikes targeted four empty facilities ranging from Beit Hanoun in the north to Rafah in the south, causing damage but no casualties.   The Israeli army said its "aircraft targeted two Hamas military training facilities and two military sites in the Gaza Strip".   "The IDF holds Hamas responsible and accountable for all attacks emanating from the Gaza Strip," a statement read.   Late yesterday, two rockets fired from Gaza hit southern Israel, without causing casualties or damage.   Since the end of the devastating war between   Israel  and Gaza militants in the summer of 2014, nearly 30 projectiles fired from the Hamas-controlled Palestinian enclave have hit the Jewish state, according to military data.   Sunni militants claiming links to the Islamic State jihadist group have said they were behind   rocket fire  from the Palestinian enclave in recent months, but Israel holds Gaza's Islamist rulers Hamas responsible for all such incidents.   Also yesterday, two Palestinians were slightly wounded by Israeli gunfire after they stormed the border fence in northern Gaza, the Israeli army and Gaza medics said. rocket fire,israel,Hamas,Gaza StripThe Israeli army said its "aircraft targeted two Hamas military training facilities and two military sites in the Gaza Strip".

No check on entry of cars with wrong numbers at city’s bordersGURGAON: It may have got off to a decent start in the national capital, but there was hardly any enforcement of the oddeven rule at Delhi's borders with Gurgaon and Noida.  In the Millennium City, a number of even-numbered cars were spotted heading to Delhi. Possibly, some thought it worth taking the risk, figuring there might not be enough traffic cops on the roads to implement the policy. They were right about the traffic officials. There were none at the three entry points into Gurgaon from Delhi — Sirhaul, on NH-8, Ayanagar on Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road, and Kapashera on the Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road.   However, from 7am, the only people seen manning the aforesaid points were volunteers from the Civil Defence (south district). Sporting fluorescent yellow jackets, Fateh Singh and his team of four were at hand to keep an eye on even-numbered cars crossing into Delhi at Ayanagar. Unsurprisingly, they were given short shrift by vehicles who had no plans of slowing down. A few swanky even-numbered sedans and SUVs sped by arrogantly, unmindful of the volunteers.   "We don't have the power to stop, impound or challan vehicles that shouldn't be plying on the roads today — only a traffic inspector has that power," said Fateh Singh. "All we can do is to stop those cars and point out to the drivers the error of their ways. We'll give them a rose and request them, in future, to keep in mind the new rules," he added.   The sub-divisional magistrate (Mehrauli) dropped in at the Ayanagar border point around 10 am. Onkar Marathe came to distribute kit, placards and pamphlets to the volunteers. Marathe said traffic cops and a team from the transport department would be reaching soon, though no one had come by 11am. Clearly, New Year's eve had left the city's traffic police stretched.   Meanwhile, the city's auto drivers, expecting to cash in on the edd-even chaos, were left disappointed. On the day, Gurgaon saw very low footfall of the floating population.   Though at Delhi-Noida border, both traffic policemen and volunteers of the Delhi Civil Defence were deployed, enforcement officials did not challan people who entered the national capital on evennumber cars, at the entry gate, while volunteers greeted the violators with roses and urged them to follow traffic rules.  Officials told TOIthat they have been ordered to not issue challans to violators at the entry gate to avoid traffic chaos. Some people were seen sharing a cab for commuting from Noida to Delhi on Friday.sports From 7am, the only people seen manning the aforesaid points were volunteers from the Civil Defence (south district).

Pathankot attack raises serious concerns: CongressNEW DELHI: The attack on   Pathankot  air base raises security concerns for Punjab as the state is witnessing a sudden surge in such activities after being peaceful for the last 20 years, Congress today said.   Further, with the incident coming on the heels of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent surprise visit to   Pakistan  to meet   Nawaz Sharif , the party wondered whether he would take up the matter with his counterpart in the neighbouring country even as the ruling BJP said that the aim was to "constantly do the best" to deal with the situation.   "Why have there been two terror attacks in Punjab, a state that has not seen any terror activities in over 20 years. Even the third attack in Udhampur (in J-K) was on the border of Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir," Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said.   "The first (attack in Punjab) was in Dinanagar in Gurdaspur and now in Panthankot, where our frontline security installation is located," he said.   The attacks raise questions about the government's strategy for checking such incidents, he added.   "Will Prime Minister take up the issue with Pakistan, now that he has recently visited the country. How does the government propose to control and check the terror coming from Pakistan. These are important issues that the PM needs to address. Why is Punjab suddenly becoming a hotbed of such activities," Surjewala said.   Suspected Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists from Pakistan today struck at an Air Force base in Pathankot in Punjab, killing two air personnel while four of the attackers were killed in an operation that lasted more than five hours.   The attack comes just a week after the Prime Minister made an unscheduled visit to   Lahore , touching down in Pakistan for the first time, to meet Sharif.   BJP, meanwhile, said India will keep doing its best to deal with the situation.   "This is the obvious risk of terrorism that India has borne for a very long time. We are constantly going to do our best to deal with the situation and ensure that these forces are defeated," BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli said.

Pinaka II trial successful: DRDO Jodhpur: Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE), Pune, a Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) laboratory has ended the year with a bang in Jaisalmer, adding to the success story of the premier defence research establishment. The three-day-long User Assisted Trials (in this case Indian Army) of the much-awaited Pinaka II, a complete multi-barrel rocket launcher (MBRL) system with a range of 60 km, have been successfully completed as per the DRDO officials.Range of Pinaka II is 20 km more than the Pinaka I version, which has a 40 km range and has already been inducted into the forces.   DRDO officials revealed that after the successful development trials of 60 km range Pinaka II rocket systems, the same were being manufactured in huge quantities in production lines. Sources revealed that the same have been handed over to the Army as per its projected demand meeting the timeframe of December 2015. "And now, the user assisted trials have been completed successfully in Pokhran in the past three days or so," said an official pleading anonymity about these covert trials marking a glorious year end for DRDO as well as the Army . Pinaka has been indigenously developed by ARDE, Pune, a DRDO laboratory .   Interestingly , the `submunition warheads', amongst the eight different kinds of warheads for Pinaka, successfully tested during advanced development trials for Pinaka I in Pokhran field firing range in Rajasthan during June 2015, paved way for it to be used in Pinaka II as well.These act as a force-multiplier while supplementing the artillery guns as well.Pinaka, the indigenous unguided rocket system which has been undergoing extensive testing since the past 20 years is capable of neutralising large areas with rapid salvos. Having proven its mettle during Kargil war while neutralising the mountain peaks off the enemy , Pinaka akes pride in its low cost vis-a-vis other such rocket systems in the world bestowed with shoot and scoot capabilities.   Meanwhile, `proof trials' for the production lots of Pinaka I wherein random Pinakas are picked up to test the performance standards of a specific lot were also conducted here as per the officials. `Inhouse' or the `technical trials', actually a part of the developments trials for Pinaka II have been completed in two phases ncluding the first phase in Balasore for checking the range and the second one at Pokhran for checking the accuracy and consistency in performance levels.   DRDO officials disclosed that not only the number of Pinaka rockets to be manufactured is being increased in production lines to cater for the Army's projected needs aimed at giving boost to concerned regiments but even the strike capability in terms of an even longer range for Pinaka II is in pipeline. ARDE and other DRDO officials were present along with the Indian Army officials during these trials at Pokhran.   Pinaka can carry a payload of more than 100 kg   Pinaka battery consists of six launchers, each equipped with 12 rockets. Capable of carrying a payload of more than 100 kg, Pinaka went into development in 1986 and production in 1998. Having proven its mettle during Kargil, indigenous Pinaka MBRL mounted on a Tatra truck can act as a force-multiplier as an Area Weapon System while firing a salvo of 12 High Explosive (HE) rockets in 44 seconds and neutralizing a marked area of 3.9 sq km. This thermo-baric ammunition has become even more lethal while being able to operate from a mobile launcher at extreme temperature ranges of -10 degrees Celsius to 55 degrees Celsius or so, with a quicker reaction time and capability to carry various kinds of warheads. The MBRL system can work in various modes including autonomous mode while being controlled by a fire control computer, standalone mode, manual mode or remote mode etc.   Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE), Pune, a Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) laboratory has ended the year with a bang in Jaisalmer, adding to the success story of the premier defence research establishment.

India-Pakistan ties: For Narendra Modi & Nawaz Sharif, the challenge will be overcoming formidable obstacles at homeAs they clasped hands while walking down the red carpet at the Lahore airport recently,   Nawaz Sharif  of Pakistan and   Narendra Modi  of India looked more like close friends than the leaders of two countries whose tense relations have long been a threat to regional stability.   Modi's visit to Pakistan was arranged on short notice and marked the first visit by an Indian prime minister in almost 12 years. Sharif's warm greeting and hosting of Modi at the Sharif family home set a welcome atmosphere for talks aimed at resuming a stalled dialogue on critical economic and security issues. But while the two leaders got the political optics right, the challenge, as always, will be overcoming formidable obstacles at home.   Sharif has pressed for engagement with India; Modi has been conflicted. He invited Sharif to his inauguration last year but soon after canceled high-level talks, annoyed that   Pakistani diplomats  had met with separatist leaders from disputed   Kashmir . Modi has also taken a harder line than his predecessor on security issues involving Pakistan.   Domestic constraints limit both leaders, especially Sharif. His power is eclipsed by an army that controls the fastest-growing nuclear weapons program in the world and has long played a double game of taking US assistance while supporting the   Taliban  in   Afghanistan  as well as militants opposed to India.   The army exploits tensions with India to bolster its importance in Pakistan. Whether the generals support Sharif's new outreach to Modi is unclear, though it seems clear that contact between the two nuclear-armed countries is imperative given the many points of friction, including Afghanistan and Kashmir.   Modi seems to have finally decided that better relations not only are necessary but require his personal involvement. He may also have concluded that improved ties with Pakistan could help him realize his domestic ambitions, which include transforming India into an economic power. So far he has not delivered on that promise, spurring protests by middle-class Indians demanding more good jobs.   Meanwhile, members of his government and political party have been inflaming sectarian tensions, alarming many Indians and damaging Modi's international reputation. A recent report by the Council on Foreign Relations concluded that without market reforms India risks being left behind in international trade and that the risk of conflict with Pakistan "threatens to drag India down." The group said India should seek better relations "for the sake of its own future."   One major test of the Modi-Sharif relationship will be whether the two can work together to promote peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban, which has been making gains on the battlefield. Pakistan has given assistance and a haven to the   Afghan Taliban  as a hedge against India, while India has supported and provided military assistance to the Afghan government.   US officials say they believe Pakistan's army has become more serious about fighting the Taliban and encouraging peace talks because the generals are increasingly worried that a Taliban victory could make Afghanistan a more attractive magnet for the Islamic State and other militants who could threaten Pakistan. Other experts are doubtful. Whether a stronger personal connection between Modi and Sharif can lead to real trust and cooperation on such issues remains to be seen.

There should be no talks with Pakistan, says MS BittaCHANDIGARH: Strongly condemning the attack by suspected Pakistani terrorists on an Air Force base in Pathankot, Chairman of the All India Anti-Terrorist Front, M S Bitta today said there should be no talks with   Pakistan  till cross-border terrorism is not stopped.   "It is a dastardly and a cowardly act. I am of the view that there should be no talks with Pakistan till the time cross-border terrorism is not stopped. India should forthwith stop dialogues with Pakistan, completely seal the borders and suspend the Lahore bus, train services, and other engagements," Bitta said.   Bitta, who had survived a terrorist attack in Delhi in 1993 when he was the chief of the Youth Congress, said the timing of the attack reminded him of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's visit to Lahore when Pakistani army was planning an attack on Kargil.   "In my opinon, Prime Minister   Narendra Modi  should not have visited Pakistan, even if it was not a formal visit. I feel ISI in Pakistan is stronger than the government there. Whenever any good initiative is taken from our side, they betray us," he told PTI over phone.   "I will say that political parties will have to change their politics and put the fight against terrorism at highest priority, other things can come later. If this is not done, then no one can save this country," Bitta said.   "Terrorists don't have any religion, they are out there to destroy and kill innocent people," he stated.   He also said that   Punjab  now has to maintain maximum alert.   "Pakistan will try to make Punjab soft target again, we will have to be alert. I appeal to political parties in Punjab also that peace returned to the state after so much bloodshed during militancy days, let's try to save it otherwise it is on Pakistan's radar and consequences can be grave," he added.   Bitta also said, "We need to strengthen our security system, like on the pattern of Gujarat, which also shares border with Pakistan".   "We should also raise people's awareness about the threat which terrorisim poses, like the way we had done in Punjab during terrorism days. Political parties must also play a responsible role to educate people. Unfortunately, they just debate and fight on TV and the matter ends there," he said.

Pathankot attack: Punjab Congress President Amarinder Singh flays attempts to sabotage Indo-Pak peaceCHANDIGARH: Punjab Congress   President Amarinder Singh  today condemned the terror attack on the Air Force base in Pathankot, saying it was a clear attempt by rogue elements in   Pakistan  to sabotage the peace process, which must not be allowed to be happen.   Noting that the attack took place only a few days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Lahore visit, Singh hoped that it was not a repeat of what happened after then Prime Minister A B Vajpayee's Lahore bus journey. The Kargil war took place soon after Vajpayee's visit.   "It is a clear attempt by rogue elements in Pakistan to subvert and sabotage the peace process between the two countries (India and Pakistan) which must not be allowed at any cost", the Congress Deputy Leader in the Lok Sabha said here.   "It is the responsibility of the Pakistan government to identify such elements and deal with them with a firm hand," he said.   The former Punjab Chief Minister said it reminded him of then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's visit to Lahore, while Pakistani army was planning an attack on Kargil.   "I hope it is not the repeat of what happened after the Lahore bus journey", the Amritsar MP said, while pointing out that the attack has taken place only a few days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Lahore visit.   He said while the peace process should continue, India at the same time must not lower its guard.   "We can't allow our people, soldiers and police personnel to be killed by the militants from across the border and Pakistan needs to own up responsibility and deal with such elements firmly", he said, adding, they know where the problem lies and they must resolve it.   Capt Amarinder also saluted the martyrs for their bravery.   "Even as we grieve your loss, the entire nation is proud of you for the exemplary valour and courage you have shown today by killing the terrorists and the nation will always remember your great sacrifice", he said.   "Our security personnel were alert, but the surprise element lies with the attackers and who knows when and where they will strike," he said.

CPI urges India, Pakistan not to fall into trap of terror outfits NEW DELHI:   CPI  today condemned the attack on Pathankot air base and urged both   India  and   Pakistan  not to fall into the "trap of provocation" by terror outfits by derailing peace talks between them in the wake of the attack.   "We strongly condemn the attack. It happened after the Prime Minister's visit to Pakistan. This appears to be an attempt by terror outfits to derail any dialogue process and initiative taken by both the countries.   "Both the countries should not fall into the trap of provocation of the terror outfits who must be given a strong message that they cannot derail the dialogue process," CPI national secretary D Raja said.   The Rajya Sabha member also demanded that New Delhi take up the issue with Islamabad and push for action against the ones responsible for the attack.   "The Government of India must take up the issue with Pakistan Government demanding action against the   terrorists ," Raja added.   In a pre-dawn attack, a group of heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists, suspected to belong to Jaish-e-Mohammed outfit, struck at an Air Force base here in Punjab, leading to a fierce gun battle in which three security personnel were killed along with four attackers.   The terrorists, who struck just a week after Modi's unscheduled visit to Lahore, could not, however, penetrate defence cordon at the Air base which is located close to the border with Pakistan as they met with effective response from the security forces, police and security officials said.

Pathankot terror attack: Larger tragedy may have been avertedNEW DELHI: A larger tragedy may have been averted as security forces countered an impending attack on an air force station in the wee hours of the morning in Pathankot.

Government needs to reassess nature of engagement with Pakistan: CongressPATHANKOT: Congress leader Ashwani Kumar today said the Prime Minister and Central government will have to reassess the direction and nature of engagement with   Pakistan  in the light of ground realities after armed Pak   terrorists  struck at an Air Force base in a pre-dawn attack.   Kumar, who visited the post here amid anti-Pak protests, said the gaps, if any, in intelligence and security apparatus need to be filled as the attack could not be foiled despite reported information with agencies about it.   The former Union Minister also said Congress, which condemns the dastardly attack, stood united in fighting terror and fully backs the government and armed forces fighting against terrorism.   "Congress condemns this dastardly attack against the unity and integrity of India. This terror attack seems obviously sponsored by forces inimical to India across the border. There is a set pattern and design in these attacks.   "Prime Minister   Narendra Modi  and the Central government will have to reassess the direction and nature of the engagement with Pakistan in the light of the ground realities," he told PTI.   He lamented that this is the third such attack in the area bordering Pakistan in the last six months as similar attacks sponsored by forces across the border inimical to India have been launched earlier in Udhampur in Jammu and Kashmir and in Dinanagar in Gurdaspur district of Punjab.   "Peace is the dividend of power and not of weaknesses," he said.   Concerned over the role of intelligence agencies, he said, "Sources say that the   Intelligence Bureau  had information 48 hours ago that there is a possibility of an attack.   "That is what we are told. Yet we could not foil this attack. Therefore, we need to fill-in, in case there are any gaps in the intelligence and security apparatus."   He lamented that this is third attack in six months and second in Punjab as it is directed towards important installations of defence and IAF.   Kumar lamented that the attacks, which have boosted the morale of terrorists, come within days of Prime Minister returning after a visit to Pakistan.   "The Prime Minister's visit was intended to advance a hand of friendship to Pakistan and in return what we see is another terrorist attack," he said.

PVC pipes to digging, heroin smuggling continues across India-Pakistan borderAMRITSAR: Using PVC pipes, digging through the earth or just throwing consignments over the barbed wire fence are some of the methods used by smugglers from Pakistan to push   heroin  consignments into India.   Since an electrified barbed wire fence, 300 metres to 800 metres inside Indian territory, runs along the entire 553-km-long international border with Pakistan in Punjab, the drug runners adopt various methods to smuggle heroin consignments. These include pushing smaller packets of heroin by putting PVC pipes across the barbed wire fence, throwing packets over the fence or digging the packets in agricultural fields across the fence (but in Indian territory) which are later dug out by farmers who cultivate their land across the fence, a   BSF  officer said.   Alert   Border Security Force  (BSF) troopers maintain a 24x7 vigil along the border.   In 2015, the BSF seized nearly 345 kg of heroin, the second highest in the area and worth some Rs.1,725 crore ($26 million) in the international market.   The latest action by the BSF was on the night of Dec 20 when 22 kg of heroin worth Rs.110 crore was seized.   The BSF had, in 2014, made its highest-ever seizure of over 361 kg of heroin in the Punjab sector, comprising the frontier districts of Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Ferozepur and Fazilka, where the heroin is brought via the   Afghanistan-Pakistan  route.   "It is not easy for our troopers who have to keep a strict vigil at the international border to also keep a close watch on activities of smugglers. Most of the   smuggling  activity takes place late in the night and our troops have to work in trying conditions, including darkness and weather," a BSF commandant in the Amritsar sector told IANS.   "Our troopers have to brave extremes in climate - from sub-zero temperatures and dense fog during winter to the highs of over 45 degrees Celsius during the dusty summer. But they do all this very professionally and the the heightened vigil is reflected in the rise in seizures," he pointed out.   BSF officers along the border told IANS that smugglers from the Pakistan side take advantage of the standing crops, night darkness and climatic conditions like dense fog.   As per BSF officials and records, smugglers on both sides of the border have become more active in recent years.   In 2011, the BSF had seized just 68 kg heroin in the border belt and prior to that 115 kg in 2010, 120 kg in 2009 and 100 kg in 2008.   In 2013, the BSF had made an all-time record seizure of nearly 322 kg of heroin as against 288 kg seized in 2012.

Congress 'politicising' Pathankot terror attack: Prakash JavadekarNEW DELHI: BJP today said the resumed dialogue with   Pakistan  cannot be revoked due to "one attack" and accused   Congress  of "politicising" the Pathankot terror incident.   Union Minister   Prakash Javadekar  batted for the continuation of talks with the neighbouring country, saying "unless you talk terror, terror will not come down".   After Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Lahore initiative, the   Environment  Minister said the onus was on Pakistan to follow the solemn promise given to India in 2004 that it will not allow its land to be used for terrorism.   "This process (talks) cannot be destroyed due to one attack... Pakistan is our neighbour. You cannot change your neighbour, you can change friends and therefore we must continue with the talks but talks have to be mainly on the issue of terrorism and that's what exactly India is doing," Javadekar said.   Pakistan will have to walk the talk on the issue of terrorism, he said.   He supported Home Minister Rajnath Singh's assertion that India wanted friendship with Pakistan but will forcefully respond to any act of terrorism.   Attacking Congress, he said it had tried to politicise the Pathankot terror incident and that was highly "condemnable".   "When the whole nation is standing with the security forces, Congress is singing a different tune. It is very unfortunate and we condemn it," he said.

"The problem is that there may not be a specific threat but the threat (of terror attack) is always there. If we see the frequency of these things happening in the past, you need to be prepared all the time," Director General of Police (DGP) J&K, K   Rajendra Kumar , told PTI.    He said all the security-related measures have been put in place but there was always scope for improvement.    "We have plugged all the vulnerable infiltration routes along the border. Barricades have been put in place on the highways and checking of all the vehicles entering the state is being conducted," he said.    The DGP, who held a high-level meeting to review the security arrangements in the state following the Pathankot terror attack, also toured various border areas in Jammu district.

Pakistan number used to hire taxi by terrorists in PathankotNEW DELHI: The terrorists, who carried out the attack in Pathankot, were in regular touch with their Pakistani handlers, who even arranged a taxi for them by calling from a mobile number of that country.   Sources said the terrorists had first used a Toyota Innova vehicle yesterday and it has been found that the driver was called from a   Pakistan  number.   Security agencies are verifying with the driver's family RPT family to find out whether he (driver) had been offering regular services to Pakistan-based smugglers, who have links with the terrorists, or was it a case of him not realising that it was a Pakistan number.   The driver of the Innova was called to a particular spot near   Pathankot  where the terrorists boarded the vehicle.   The sources said that the car was used for travelling on an untarred road and dumped after a while as the rim of the vehicle got damaged.   The   terrorist  then hijacked an SUV (Mahindra SUV X500) in which a Superintendent of Punjab Police was travelling along with a friend and a cook.   The SP and the cook were forced to leave the vehicle while the friend, a jeweller, was taken as hostage.   The terrorists snatched a mobile phone from them and used it to dial the number in Pakistan which was used to call the driver of the Toyota Innova. From this number, they had called their handlers thrice and once to a family member who was told that they were on a suicide mission.   Security agencies have found that from the Pakistani mobile number, the handlers were actively giving the directions to the terrorists.   Since the Pakistani number was under surveillance, security agencies were able to find out the possible target of the terrorists, leading to dispatching of 160   NSG  commandos, army special forces besides others. terrorist,Pathankot,Pakistan,NSGSecurity agencies are questioning the driver and trying to find out whether he had been offering regular services to Pakistan-based smugglers.

Shock, anger after deadly Taliban attack on Kabul French eatery KABUL: Emotions ran high Saturday in a   Kabul  neighbourhood where a   Taliban  suicide bomber struck a French restaurant popular with expats, killing two people including a 12-year-old boy hit by flying shrapnel.   Friday's powerful bombing of Le Jardin, the second Taliban attack in Kabul in a week, reduced a building to smouldering rubble and left the residential neighbourhood strewn with debris and wrecked cars.   Shopkeeper Ahmed Massoud's cousin, a guard at the Afghan-owned restaurant, was killed as the bomber detonated his suicide vest when he stopped to frisk him.   The intensity of the blast blew out windows and left a 12-year-old Afghan boy dead on the doorstep of an adjacent grocery shop.   "I saw a huge flame and was knocked unconscious for a few minutes," said Massoud, 21, pointing at a pool of dried blood on the floor.   "Everyone in this neighbourhood knew this restaurant was a high-value target. And we paid a huge price for it."   His comment typifies what many in Afghanistan feel, seemingly trapped in a hopeless quagmire after 14 years of war, with civilians increasingly caught between the government and a resurgent Taliban.   The Taliban, who vowed to safeguard lives of ordinary Afghans before launching their annual summer offensive last year, typically attack places with a high density of civilians.   The Taliban were unable to breach   Le Jardin  -- a popular hangout for foreigners and wealthy Afghans -- but the bombing at the entrance left the working-class neighbourhood of Qala-e-Fathullah reeling in shock.   "High-ranking officials came to the restaurant in their big cars with body guards in tow," fumed 40-year-old taxi driver Mohammed Haidar.   "The blast devastated my taxi, left my house badly damaged and my wife and daughter are injured. Now where should I go? If Le Jardin's owner was here I would grab him by his collar and demand an answer."   The owner of Le Jardin, which sports a large garden festooned with rose bushes, is said to be   Hamid Akram , the powerful governor of Kabul, who was not available for comment.   The bombing evokes painful memories of an attack in January 2014 on a Lebanese restaurant in Kabul that left 21 people dead.   The raid on Taverna du Liban saw gunmen mowing down diners and staff, including 13 foreigners enjoying an evening out at a low-key social venue.   The latest bombing comes despite a renewed international push to revive peace talks with the Taliban.   President Ashraf Ghani on Thursday announced a first round of dialogue between Afghanistan, Pakistan, US and China on January 11 to lay out a comprehensive roadmap for peace.   Pakistan -- the Taliban's historic backers -- hosted a milestone first round of talks in July but the negotiations stalled when the insurgents belatedly confirmed the death of longtime leader   Mullah Omar .

Terrorists' design can't succeed in India: Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi RAMPUR (UP): Extremists have realised that their designs would never succeed in   India  due to the "tough attitude" of Prime Minister Narendra Modi towards terror and the high morale of security forces for dealing with situations like the attack in   Pathankot  today, Union minister   Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi  has said.   Also, amidst speculation as to what impact the attack today would have on the peace talks between India and Pakistan, the minister spoke of the "BJP government's policy of generating, maintaining and furthering very good relationship" with the neighbouring country.   Pointing at the operation today by security forces following the terror strike in Pathankot, he said that the way the attack was "mercilessly crushed" shows that India is geared up to respond to such activities.   "Militancy now has no wings to fly in India as they have been impressed fully by the prime minister's extremely tough handling of such elements.   "Modi's fear very much exists in the minds of the activists of Islamic State", Naqvi said as he claimed that the outfit tried to enter India but had to retreat due to Modi's "tough attitude on this count".   The Minister of State for Minority Affairs, meanwhile, congratulated Indian Muslims for their patriotism, saying they "never lend their ear to IS and crushed those elements who tried to bring the outfit to India".   Naqvi said that the day would come when   Pakistan  shall be forced to hand over LeT leader Hafiz Sayeed and fugitive don Dawood Ibrahim due to the BJP government's policy of "generating, maintaining and furthering very good relationship with Pakistan".   "This gesture of ours was proved by the recent visit of the prime minister and the much-friendly meetings (sic) with his Pakistan counterpart," he said.   Turning to Samajwadi Party-ruled Uttar Pradesh, he said that "the Centre has sanctioned Rs 3,000 crore expecting that development in the real sense of the term would take place" in the state.   He further averred confidently that BJP would form the government in the state after the 2017 elections and not ally with any other party. He said the party has formulated its strategies for achieving that goal.

Terror and talks with Pakistan can't go together, says Shiv SenaMUMBAI: Condemning the terror strike by Pakistani militants in Pathankot,   Shiv Sena  today said "terror and peace talks can't go simultaneously" as it expressed concern that the attack happened within a week of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's unscheduled visit to Lahore.   "Whenever there is an attack on us, there is no need to say who is behind it. We can say with eyes closed that attackers are from   Pakistan ," Shiv Sena spokesperson   Sanjay Raut  said here.   In a pre-dawn attack, a group of heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists, suspected to belong to Jaish-e-Mohammed outfit, struck at an Air Force base in   Pathankot  in Punjab. In the ensuing gunbattle, three security personnel were killed along with four attackers.   Noting that the attack took place after the PM's unscheduled stopover in Lahore last week, Raut said, "We don't want to play politics but its a fact that bilateral peace talks and terror attacks are taking place simultaneously. This won't do."   Peace talks and terror cannot go together and this has been Sena's stance from the beginning, said Raut, whose party is a key ally of BJP and part of the NDA government at the Centre.   "Just saying that such attacks will invite befitting reply from India won't suffice. The Union Home Minister is a serious person and we respect him. But when will we give befitting response to Pakistan?" Raut asked.   Raut's remark came in the wake of Home Minister   Rajnath Singh  saying India would hit back hard if there is any terror strike on its soil.

Pathankot attack: IAF says it foiled terror plan due to timely action, intelligenceNEW DELHI: The   IAF  today said that timely intelligence and prompt action has foiled the likely plan of terrorists to destroy its valuable assets at the   Pathankot  air base.   The Pathankot IAF facility, located about 40 kms away from the border with   Pakistan , is the base of   MiG-21  fighter planes and Mi-25 attack helicopters of Air Force.   In a statement issued nearly 15 hours after a group of heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists stormed the air base, leading to a fierce gun battle in which three security personnel were killed along with four attackers, the air force said they had intelligence that such an attack would take place.   "Intelligence inputs had been available of a likely attempt by terrorists to infiltrate into the military installation in Pathankot area. In response, preparatory actions had been taken by the Indian Air Force (IAF) to thwart any such attempt," it said.   IAF added that due to the effective preparation and coordinated efforts by all the security agencies a group of terrorists were detected by the aerial surveillance platforms as soon as they entered the Air Force Station at Pathankot.   "The infiltrators were immediately engaged and contained within a limited area, thus preventing them from entering the Technical zone where high value assets are parked.

Punjab Police 'failed' to prevent Pathankot attack despite inputs: AAPCHANDIGARH:   Aam Aadmi Party  today blamed   Punjab  Police for "failing to prevent" terror attack at   Pathankot  despite central intelligence agencies informing the state authorities about the possible threat in advance.   "It is a total failure of the Punjab police in preventing second terror attack after   Dinanagar  last year. The terrorists managed to strike at Pathankot in spite of the fact that central intelligence agencies had alerted the state police about the possible terror attack," AAP state convenor Such Singh Chottepur said.   "The attack by terrorists at Pathankot was a challenge to the country's security," he said.   He further said the state police should have been alert when one of its officers was abducted by the terrorists.   "A red alert was sounded in the state after the SP was kidnapped. But state police completely failed in tracing the terrorists," he alleged, describing the incident as "unfortunate".   AAP also took a dig at Prime Minister   Narendra Modi , saying the suspected Pakistani terrorists struck after his unscheduled visit to the neighbouring country last week.

Pathankot terror attack: Congress-BJP spar, Shiv Sena asks where is the actionNEW DELHI: The   Pathankot terror attack  sparked a fresh round of political slugfest with   Congress  questioning the Modi government's handling of Pakistan affairs and   BJP  hitting back, accusing it of trying to "politicise" the incident while ally Shiv Sena sought a befitting response.   Targeting the government, Congress said the attack came a week after Prime Minister   Narendra Modi  visited Lahore to meet his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif and this showed that ISI continues to sustain and support terror activities against India.   The opposition party also reminded Modi of his promise to assertively handle ties with the neighbouring country.   Congress has accused the Modi government of flip-flops in its Pak policy. While on the one hand the government has asserted that terror and talks cannot go together, on the other Modi has met Sharif and preparations are underway for resumption of comprehensive dialogue, the opposition party said.   "It's indeed a very serious matter as seven days after Modi visited Pakistan to meet Nawaz Sharif, a terrorist module comes from Pakistan and attacks in Punjab and attacks our frontline security installation. Two things are very clear. First, despite the PM's visit, ISI continues to sustain and support terror activities against India.   "Secondly the terror camps run by terrorists in POK for carrying on anti-India activity continues to be supported by Pakistani establishments. It raises security concerns for Punjab as the state is witnessing a sudden surge in such activities after being peaceful for the last 20 years," Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala told reporters here.   Hitting back, Union Minister and BJP leader Prakash Javadekar said it was "condemnable" that Congress was "politicising" the terror attack.   "While the whole country is standing with our brave soldiers, Congress is singing a different tune. It is trying to politicise the issue. It is unfortunate and we condemn it," he said.   BJP reacted cautiously on the attack's possible impact on the Indo-Pak talks, saying "a right decision will be taken at the right time".   "We congratulate our armed forces that they were able to thwart it with their wisdom and valour. India is capable of giving a befitting reply to any terror attack," BJP secretary and media department head Shrikant Sharma said.   Home Minister Rajnath Singh said India wanted good relations with the neighbouring country but if there is any terror attack on India, a befitting reply will be given.   Taking a swipe at the government, Sena said the public is waiting for a response in the similar language and wondered "where is that language, that action?"   Party leader Sanjay Raut said, "If our Air base is attacked by terrorists from Pakistan, the responsibility is with Pakistan, but they (terrorists) get shelter there, they get support from across the border..."

Pathankot attack: ISI may have joined hands with Jaish-e-Mohammed, say intelligence officialsBy Rajnish Singh   NEW DELHI: Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy agency has reportedly joined hands with banned Islamic militant group   Jaish-e-Mohammed  (JeM) to "revive" the latter's base, according to intelligence sources.   The tie-up is to carry out terrorist attacks across India, the sources told IANS on condition of anonymity.   Over the last eight months, intelligence officials had intercepted several Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calls of cross border discussion between   ISI  agents and their contacts in terror modules in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.   Sources said the Saturday fidayeen attack at the frontline Indian Air Force (IAF) base in Pathankot in northern Punjab could have been carried out JeM militants who were being backed by ISI for several months.   "We are not very sure if the intercepted calls were to JeM militants, but the possibility is high," the sources said.   "After LeT (Lashkar-e-Taiba) and   SIMI  (Students Islamic Movement of India), the ISI is now reported to be backing JeM for its revival in Kashmir and other Indian cities. ISI's motive is to establish large number of terror outfit modules of different militant groups in several parts of the country," the official said.   Maulana Masood Azhar formed Jaish-e-Mohammed in March 2000, shortly after his release from prison in December 1999, in exchange for passengers of the hijacked Indian Airlines flight IC 814 which was taken to Kandahar, in Afghanistan.   Sources said the group, in coordination with LeT, was implicated in the 2001 attack on Indian Parliament in New Delhi. In December 2002, four JeM members were caught by Indian authorities and put on trial. All four were found guilty. One of the accused, Afzal Guru, was sentenced to death for his role in the attack.   The group was formed after a split within Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (HUM), another militant group. A majority of HUM members joined JeM.   IANS in its December 30 report last year had detailed LeT plans on a new year attack which included Punjab as a prime target. The attack, it was said, would be carried out to avenge the death of Abu Qasim, a senior commander of LeT who was killed in an encounter with security forces. Qasim had carried out an attack on a BSF convoy in August in Udhampur, Punjab.   Intelligence officials had told the agency that the alert was based on the busting of a pan-Indian ISI-backed spying ring unearthed by Delhi Police's Crime Branch wing in November-December last year.

Pathankot attack: Terrorists may have sneaked in through Bamiyal villageNEW DELHI: The five heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists, who carried out the suicide attack on the key   Pathankot  IAF base in Punjab, are believed to have infiltrated into India during the intervening night of December 30-31 from a spot near Bamiyal village in Pathankot, located close to the international border.   The terrorists, official sources said, crossed over near Shakargarh in   Pakistan  to Bamiyal village and later changed into Army fatigues before kidnapping Salwinder Singh, a Superintendent of Police-rank officer, who was shunted out from Gurdaspur to take charge as Assistant Commandant of 75th battalion of Punjab Armed Police, at Kolian village.

Resumption of dialogue process is a hope-generating step: MirwaizHurriyat Conference chief Mirwaiz Umar Farooq on Friday termed the resumption of India-Pakistan talks as a step that generates hope and expressed confidence that the new year will usher in an atmosphere of positive understanding to help resolve all the bilateral issues. “The resumption of dialogue process between New Delhi and Islamabad is a hope-generating step. We hope that the arrival of the New Year 2016 would foster an atmosphere of better relations and positive understanding between India and Pakistan leading to resolution of all pending issues including the vexed issue of Jammu and Kashmir,” Mirwaiz said addressing the Friday congregation at Jamia Masjid here. He said the two nuclear neighbours have no option but to find a lasting solution to the Kashmir issue. “We hope that the two countries understand the fact that it is this (Kashmir) issue and not Siachen, Sir Creek or trade and travel which has kept peace in entire South Asia hostage for the past seven decades and led to three wars and killings of innumerable human beings,” the separatist leader said. He hoped that the two countries would now take steps to prioritise the resolution of the vexed Kashmir issue. “There is no military solution to this issue because had it been so, the issue would have not remained unresolved since 1947. It has been recognised by the international community as well that negotiations provide the best way of resolving issues and Kashmir issue should also be addressed and resolved through dialogue,” he said. The Hurriyat chairman said if both the countries wish to have a new beginning of peace and stability based on the spirit of mutual understanding and respect, it should start from Kashmir. “The growing cordiality between the two countries can reflect on the ground in Kashmir only when black laws like AFSPA and PSA are withdrawn, all the political prisoners are freed from the jails, there is an end to curbs and restrictions on the peaceful political, social and religious activities of Hurriyat leadership, right to assemble and protest of the people is respected,” he said. He also demanded disbanding of “terror groups with the nomenclature VDCs (Village Defence Committees) which are there to terrorise people of a particular outlook”.

Even the third attack in Udhampur (in J&K) was on the border of Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir,” Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said. “The first (attack in Punjab) was in Dinanagar in Gurdaspur and now in Panthankot, where our frontline security installation is located,” he said. The attacks raise questions about the government’s strategy for checking such incidents, he added. “Will Prime Minister take up the issue with Pakistan, now that he has recently visited the country? How does the government propose to control and check the terror coming from Pakistan. These are important issues that the PM needs to address. Why is Punjab suddenly becoming a hotbed of such activities,” Surjewala said. The attack comes just a week after the Prime Minister made an unscheduled visit to Lahore, touching down in Pakistan for the first time, to meet Sharif.

They reached the Chennai airport from London at 5.30 a.m. by British Airways flight BA 35. The students were then asked to wait at the immigration counter for questioning. Ayub, a parent, said he was waiting to receive his daughter and had had no idea about when she would come out of the airport after the questioning at the immigration counter. Immigration sources at the airport said the students were only questioned and they were not detained or arrested and that all left the airport by 8.30 a.m. “There are no complaints against them. It is just a routine procedure and the enquiry was smooth and was not delayed,” they added. The universities they were studying at have been blacklisted by U.S. authorities
Pathankot attack is an attempt to sabotage Indo-Pak peace: Amarinder Singh  Punjab Congress President Amarinder Singh today condemned the terror attack on the Air Force base in Pathankot, saying it was a clear attempt by rogue elements in Pakistan to sabotage the peace process. Noting that the attack took place only a few days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Lahore visit, Mr. Singh hoped that it was not a repeat of what happened after then Prime Minister A B Vajpayee’s Lahore bus journey. The Kargil war took place soon after Vajpayee’s visit.  “It is the responsibility of the Pakistan government to identify such elements and deal with them with a firm hand,” he said.  He said while the peace process should continue, India at the same time must not lower its guard.  “We can’t allow our people, soldiers and police personnel to be killed by the militants from across the border and Pakistan needs to own up responsibility and deal with such elements firmly”, he said, adding, they know where the problem lies and they must resolve it. Capt Amarinder also saluted the martyrs for their bravery.  “Even as we grieve your loss, the entire nation is proud of you for the exemplary valour and courage you have shown today by killing the terrorists and the nation will always remember your great sacrifice”, he said.  “Our security personnel were alert, but the surprise element lies with the attackers and who knows when and where they will strike,” he said.

Pathankot: India’s strategic base under siegeIn the attack on the Pathankot Air Force station, one of India’s key airbases on the Western border, the air assets stationed there was miraculously saved as security forces quickly sealed off the area.  The MiG-21 BiS fighter jets and the Mi-25 and Mi-35 attack helicopters were in the technical area which was swiftly sealed off. The attack is another in a string of growing attacks on security installations.  “The infiltrators were immediately engaged and contained within a limited area, preventing them from entering the technical zone where high-value assets are parked,” the Indian Air Force said in a statement.  Analysts say lives were lost because the terrorists were at large in a civilian area, increasing the risk of collateral damage requiring caution by the forces. “They are in the domestic area, you can’t just shoot them away. There are civilians and families,” an officer said.    However, it is still surprising that even with specialist forces such as the National Security Guards (NSG) and the Garuds (Air Force Special Forces), along with others, it took close to 13 hours to neutralise all the terrorists.  “When someone approaches the base, you cannot shoot on suspicion. Someone might have a hidden weapon and fire randomly,” said a senior retired Air Force officer.  The IAF said intelligence inputs had been available of a likely attempt by terrorists to “infiltrate into the military installation in the Pathankot area”. “Due to the effective preparation and coordinated efforts by all the security agencies, a group of terrorists was detected by the aerial surveillance platforms as soon as it entered the Air Force Station at Pathankot,” a statement said.

Terrorism will end in Pakistan in new year: Raheel Sharif  Pakistan’s powerful army chief General Raheel Sharif has vowed to rid the country from the scourge of terrorism, asserting that “all negative forces” would be scuttled.  “The new year will be the year when terrorism will end,” he said yesterday while addressing tribal elders of Gwadar, Talar and Turbat areas of Makran division.

Pathankot operation ends, five terrorists killedThe 15-hour-long operation — a fierce gunbattle followed by intermittent exchange of fire — ended around 7 p.m. with security forces neutralising five Pakistani terrorists who attacked an Indian Air Force (IAF) base in the wee hours of Saturday.  Army teams leaving the Air Force area confirmed that all the terrorists were dead but as per latest reports the body of the fifth terrorist, who engaged the joint team of IAF, Army, NSG and SWAT commandoes of Punjab Police, had not been found till 7:45 p.m.  This, nearly two hours after locals heard the last gunshot and 20 minutes after the IAF choppers and aircraft monitoring the whole operation aerially had been grounded. The Punjab Police also assisted the operation by securing the perimeter of the IAF area. Officers from the force said staff from all nine police stations of the districts were on high alert after Superintendent of Police (Gurudaspur) Salvinder Singh was abducted and his vehicle was used by the attackers dressed in military fatigues. The police are now piecing together the sequence of events from Mr. Singh's abduction to his release and the attacks within hours after the earlier incident. The base under attack is surrounded by residential areas, a busy market and the village among them, dense forests and a drain, said curious locals who had gathered outside the secure area since morning. It is suspected that the attackers used the forest side to enter the high security premise after abandoning the officer and his vehicle.  Mr. Shreyas, who stays in Dhaka Chowk adjacent to the spot of the terror attack, said he woke up to the sound of gunshots and reached the spot at 5 a.m. "All I could see was barricading and heavy presence of troops as firing continued," said Mr. Shreyas.  ASI Jagtar Singh from Punjab Police recounted: "I was awake at the staff quarters next to where Division Number 2 Police station is. I heard the gunshots and even before I could make any sense of it the wireless message was flashed from the Punjab Police Control Room." He added that his senior officers too reached the spot but were not allowed to enter the premise by the IAF.

'IS suicide attack' planned in Munich: German officialsBERLIN :  German officials said today the Islamic State group was believed to be plotting a suicide bomb attack on New Year’s Eve in the southern city of Munich.German authorities were tipped off by a “friendly intelligence service” about the plan, which IS had planned to carry out around midnight, said Joachim Herrmann, interior minister for the southern state of Bavaria.“Five to seven” suspects were believed to be planning to carry out a “suicide attack” as festivities were under way to welcome in the New Year, Munich police chief Hubertus Andrae said.Police evacuated Munich’s main rail station and another station in the western suburb of Pasing after an alert of a possible “terror attack”.Rail services at the sites were also halted and police urged the public to keep away from large gatherings.Some 550 officers had been deployed to track down the suspects and secure the sites, although no arrests have been made yet.Police officers, some in riot gear, were posted at different entrances of Munich’s main rail station which was eerily quiet on a night of traditionally raucous celebrations.Some revellers sought to enter the station but were turned away.A police spokeswoman said it could not be ruled out that the attackers could seek another target.German media had earlier reported that police were acting on a tip from French authorities.European capitals are on high security alert, with Brussels and Paris both scrapping fireworks for New Year’s celebrations.Belgian police were also holding five people over an alleged New Year plot in Brussels.In Berlin, police presence has been stepped up at the Brandenburg Gate, where hundreds of thousands of people have gathered for festivities. All large bags and backpacks have been banned from the site of the huge street party.Days after the November 13 attacks in Paris claimed by the Islamic State group that left 130 dead, German police called off an international football match at the last minute due to a bomb threat.No explosives were subsequently found, and no arrests ade after the Germany-Netherlands friendly in Hanover — which was to be attended by Chancellor Angela Merkel — was cancelled and thousands of fans evacuated.Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere — who had been due to attend the match with Merkel — later said the event was cancelled “to protect the population”, but did not provide specifics.

ATTACK-GOVT 2 LAST : PTI feed, News - India TodayAsked why the terror attack could not be foiled despite Asked why the terror attack could not be foiled despite deployment of a large number of NSG commandos, the Union Home Secretary said the team of the specialised force was waiting in Pathankot for the terrorists as the exact point of possible attack was not known.  "When they (terrorists) attacked the air base, the NSG team moved immediately," he said.  Air Marshal Khosla said the main aim of the terrorists was defeated as they could not reach the technical area of the Pathnkot air base where high valued assets were kept.  "The first contact with the terrorists was made on Saturday morning at around 3.30 am. The terrorists were contained in an area where there is heavy growth and shrubs. The operation is now at a matured stage," he said.  The IAF officer said the operation was "slowed down" yesterday after the killing of four terrorists as security forces were not sure whether there were more terrorists still at large. The gun-fight resumed this afternoon when the terrorists began firing from two places.  Asked about the terror group which could be behind the attack, the Home Secretary said as per initial information it was Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) but it would be confirmed only after the operation is over.  Mehrishi said there were intelligence reports about infiltration attempts by JeM and Lashkar-e-Taiba militants and based on these inputs, 40 terrorists were neutralised by security forces since August 2015.  He said after getting information about the terrorists, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval called an emergency meeting on Friday, which was attended by Army Chief General  Dalbir Singh Suhag  besides others, to take stock of the situation and necessary instructions were given to secure government offices and vital installations along the western border.

UK-NETAJI 2LAST : PTI feed, News - India TodayThe plane was a 97-2 (Sally) twin-engined heavy bomber The plane was a 97-2 (Sally) twin-engined heavy bomber belonging to the Japanese Air Force. The route charted for it was: Saigon-Heito-Taipei-Dairen-Tokyo.  But because of the delay in departure from Saigon, the pilot decided on an unscheduled halt for the night at Tourane on the Indo-China coast instead of going as previously planned all the way to Taiwan.  There were an estimated 13-14 persons on board ?- Bose and Rahman and the rest of them Japanese.  Rahman described to the Committee: "Immediately behind the pilot was sitting Netaji, and nobody opposite to him, as the space was restricted by the petrol tanks. I was sitting immediately behind Netaji. The co-pilots seat occupied by Lt Gen Shidei was offered to Netaji, but he did not accept, as it was too small for him."  When taking off at Saigon, the plane needed almost the entire length of the runway to get airborne. This suggested it was still overloaded.  Therefore, on arrival in Tourane, the crew and other Japanese officers off-loaded "no fewer than 12 anti-aircraft machine-guns" and ammunition as well as other baggage, the Inquiry Committee noted, which reportedly reduced the weight by 600 kilos.  In Tourane, Bose spent the night at a hotel, probably Hotel Morin, the website said citing documents.  The remaining future revelations on the site aim to lay the facts behind the plane crash the next day that is believed to have killed Netaji, the website said.

ATTACK-LD EXPERTS 2 LAST : PTI feed, News - India TodayDulat said the Pathankot operation had raised many Dulat said the Pathankot operation had raised many questions including those about the role of security forces who could not neutralise the terrorists fast.  "How can the terrorists enter so easily without getting noticed and that too with such a huge quantity of ammunition? Are the terrorist also paying their way through like the drug cartels? These questions need an early answer," he said.  Brigadier Gurmeet Kanwal (Retd) said it was "obvious" that there were lapses. However, he refrained from speaking further on the operation, saying more details should come out first.  However, he said that the attack showed that Pakistani army and the ISI were not on board with the civilian government when it comes to peace with India.  Kanwal said India should have a two-pronged strategy under which they should continue to talk to the civilian government there and also hit back hard at the LoC whenever there is conclusive evidence of Pakistani role in terror attacks in the country.  Nitin Pai, Director of The Takshashila Institution, tweeted saying, "Just dont know what to say about the response to #PathankotAttack. Numb."  Air Vice Marshall (Retd) Manmohan Bahadur questioned the delay in tracking down the terrorists after they had kidnapped Gurdaspur Superintendent of Police Salwinder Singh.

Pathankot attack: High casualty not lapse, says govt but : PTI feed, News - India Todayexperts slam handling  New Delhi, Jan 3 (PTI) The government today asserted the high casualties suffered by the security forces despite advance intelligence about an impending terror attack in Pathankot was "not a lapse" even as defence experts questioned the way the brazen assault was handled.  "I dont consider it a lapse at all. In such situations where weapons are there, some injuries and some deaths will happen on this side also," Home Secretary Rajiv Mehreshi told reporters here in the first official press conference, 36 hours after the attack on Indian Air Force base in Pathankot began.  While four terrorists were killed yesterday and operation was on to neutralise other two holed up at the base, seven soldiers including a commando each from the IAF and the NSG were killed while 20 others were left injured.  The high casualty among security forces despite prior intelligence warning and deployment of over 250 additional security personnel including special forces, has raised several questions.  Former Western Air Command Chief Air Marshall P S Ahulwalia, who had commanded the Pathankot Air base during his service, said coordination between various security agencies "could have been better" to minimise causalities among security forces.  "The success or otherwise of any operation could be judged by the following -- whether the terrorists were able to achieve their objective, minimal causality to our own forces, no collateral damage and attackers being neutralised in optimal time frame.  "The terrorist were not able to achieve their objective and they could not reach their target. However, we have lost more men and this could have been prevented by effective coordination. And also that the time taken to neutralise the attackers is way too long," he said.  Many also questioned why the government did not divulge full details of casualty figures last night itself.  Though unconfirmed reports had said there were six casualties among the security forces, the defence ministry had only confirmed 3 martyrs.  It was only this morning that they revised the figure to six claiming that only three had died last night. However, it later transpired that the six had died yesterday itself.  Asked why the details of those killed were not made available yesterday, an IAF spokesperson said," There are procedures to be followed and first the next of kin of the deceased are to be informed."  Former RAW Chief A S Dulat raised questions about failure of security agencies in thwarting the attack.  "Generally intelligence agencies get the flak but here is a case when you had a pinpointed intelligence and still you could not make it. Why?" he said.

Pathankot terrorists may have entered unnoticed in IAF campus on January 1 afternoonNEW DELHI: The   terrorists  who struck at IAF base in   Pathankot  yesterday and who are believed to be from Pakistan-based JeM terror outfit may have stationed themselves within the complex since January one itself apparently unnoticed.    The terrorists, who sneaked into India on December 30 and 31 and made their way to Pathankot air base using the vehicle of a Punjab Police Superintendent of Police rank officer, are now believed to have entered the   IAF campus  on the afternoon of January one.    The attackers had hijacked the private vehicle carrying the Gurdaspur SP, his friend Rajesh Verma and the SP's orderly.    As the security agencies probed the sequence of events that led to the unsuccessful attack to target fighters and helicopters, it has emerged that the terrorists had "comfortably housed" themselves within the IAF campus during the day time, sources privy to the probe said today.    The cell tower for all the calls made by the terrorists from the mobile phone of Verma, a jeweller and a friend of the police officer whose vehicle was hijacked in the afternoon of January one and barely hours before launching the attack, were same, the sources said.    The calls made from the phone of Verma were routed through the same mobile phone tower throughout January one and the intervening night before the attack was launched, the sources said.    The terrorists, after breaching the security of the IAF base, had apparently hid themselves in the thick forest area of the campus which has an area of around 1800 to 2000 acres.    Officials termed it as a "serious security breach" which will be investigated only after the operation inside the campus is over and an all clear signal was received from the IAF authorities.    The IAF authorities have been asked to preserve the register of sentry duties of January one and a through questioning is expected once the operation is over, the sources said.

Azad accuses Pak of abetting Pathankot attack : PTI feed, News - India TodayNew Delhi, Jan 3 (PTI) Condemning the terror attack on the IAF base in Pathankot, senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad today accused Pakistan of "abetting" the attack and also questioned the "consistently inconsistent" Pakistan policy being pursued by NDA government.  "Its a cowardly act of enemies of peace and humanity which are aided and abetted from the soil of Pakistan, and our security forces are capable enough to respond adequately and appropriately," Azad, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, said in a statement.  He further said though the time is not opportune to comment on the flip-flops and weak-kneed Pakistan policy of the NDA government,as our security forces are battling the terrorist assault at Pathankot airbase launched by anti-India forces from across the border, there remains a dire need to revisit the "wishy washy" and "consistently inconsistent" Pakistan policy being pursued by NDA government.  Azad called the attack dastardly and gruesome and said the act has been carried out by Pakistan-backed terrorists at the Pathankot air base in Punjab.  Coming down heavily onPakistan and its "terror sponsoring" network, Azad said such "dastardly acts" are not going to "cow us down or shake our resolve as a nation to combat and counter the evil designs of terror spreading networks."  Expressing condolence to the families of the martyred soldiers, Azad said,"As the nation mourns the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, I stand in solidarity with the bereaved families in their hour of grief."

Delhi Govt on odd-even formula: Arrangements made for tomorrow : PTI feed, News - India TodayNew Delhi, Jan 3 (PTI) A day before its implementation on a full-fledged working day, the Delhi government today said that elaborate arrangements have been made to meet the "real challenge" as part of which volunteers will be using hidden cameras to take snaps of violators and additional police forces would be fielded to ensure its effective compliance.  Transport minister Gopal Rai today held a coordination committee meeting which was attended by senior officers from Traffic Police, Delhi Police, civil defence force, Metro officials and other agency heads engaged in implementation of the ambitious car-rationing scheme, which came into force on January 1.  The governments move to ask the volunteers, comprising civil defence personnel, NCC and NSS cadets, to click pictures assumes significance as they were initially asked to focus on mindset change by resorting to polite tactics like handing out roses.  "As we saw that on the first day of this pilot project, people came out with odd-numbered vehicles and on the second day yesterday, even-numbered vehicles plied on the capital roads. This itself is an indication that the mindset of people for environment is changing and I salute all Delhiites for this 2 days success", Gopal Rai said after the meeting here.  The government said that DTC would possibly ferry around 64 lakh commuters tomorrow onwards, much more than the usual figures, while Metro is expected to carry 32 lakh commuters against the previous data of 26 lakh daily.  "Civil defence volunteers will be given mobile camera and hidden cameras to be used to track violators. Very strong monitoring would be resorted to and no soft approach would be taken. Additional 100 teams of traffic police will be fielded on roads to monitor," Rai said.  Rai also mentioned that "a few people" want to ensure the failure of this scheme.  "Today one person has written on my twitter account that tomorrow some miscreants are being sent from Meerut, Haryana and UP to create chaos in Delhis roads. I dont know how much truth lies there now but I have received such message for the first time only. So this shows that how some nervous people can stoop to such levels because of our success", Rai said. more PTI ARK SBR MPB SKV RGcivil defence,minister Gopal Rai,lakh commuters,civil defence force,civil defence personnel,ambitious car-rationing scheme,additional police forces,coordination committee meeting,PTI ARK SBR,traffic policeDelhi Govt on odd-even formula: Arrangements made for tomorrow

Attack on IAF base may pose challenge to Indo-Pak talks: media : PTI feed, News - India TodayFrom Sajjad Hussain  Islamabad, Jan 3 (PTI) Pakistani media outlets today said the brazen attack by militants at a key Indian Air Force base will pose a "challenge to attempts to resurrect" the dialogue process between the two neighbours despite the goodwill generated by recent high-level meetings between their leaders.  On its front page lead Gunmen mount brazen attack on Indian air force base, the Express Tribune said the attack was over but it posed a "challenge to attempts to resurrect a moribund dialogue process between the two neighbours".  The News International reported that the assault by gunmen came a week after Prime Minister  Narendra Modi  made an unscheduled visit to his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif in an effort to revive bilateral talks.  "Previous attempts at dialogue between the nuclear-armed neighbours have been derailed by similar incidents but, as Pakistani authorities condemned the raid, experts suggested the latest negotiations would prove more durable," it opined.  Dawn said that immediate indications from India after the Pathankot incident suggested that the foreign secretaries talks would go ahead despite the setback, but the incident would impact the atmospherics.  "India expects to complete initial probe into the incident before the meeting and its position at the talks would depend a lot on what comes out of the investigation," the paper said.  "The Foreign Office said it hoped to build on the goodwill generated by recent high-level contacts," it added.  As print media mostly focused on the attack and its likely impact on the peace process, the electronic media was busy in a matching response to Indian TV channels trying to find Pakistan link to the attack.  Urdu language newspapers also gave wide coverage to the incident, while mostly focusing on the details of the attack and response by the Indian security forces. They also criticised accusation against Pakistan without investigations.  Influential Jang newspaper reported that Indian officials in a typical kneejerk reaction blamed Pakistan for the attack.  Heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists yesterday attempted to storm the Air Force base in Pathankot, triggering a day-long gunbattle in which three security men and all the five infiltrators were killed.  Three other security men succumbed to injuries in a hospital later and one NSG member was killed while defusing the grenade at the scene of the terror attack, taking the toll of Indian security personnel to seven.  The attackers were believed to have infiltrated from Pakistan and there was speculation that they may belong to Jaish-e-Mohammad headed by Maulana Masood Azhar of the Kandahar hijack episode.

(Updating with additional quotes) : PTI feed, News - India TodayJeM militants suspected to be planning attacks in Delhi:police  New Delhi, Jan 3 (PTI) Two Jaish-e-Mohammed militants were suspected to have sneaked into the national capital and were planning high-profile attacks, including taking hostages, following which security was today stepped up in the city, a day after the Pathankot Air Base strike by the same Pakistan- based outfit.

Pathankot attack was poorly planned: Experts : Mail Today, News - India TodayThe slain suspected Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists, who struck the Pathankot air force station in the wee hours of Saturday and were later neutralised in an operation launched by the security forces, wanted to launch a bigger terror strike. That is the reason why they neither killed abducted senior Punjab cop Salwinder Singh and his companions nor took them hostage. Experts have termed the attack as an immature act. The slain terrorists made three major mistakes which proves the attack was poorly planned. First, the suicide bombers beat up a cop and his companions before releasing them. Moreover, they even used the senior cop's phone to call their handlers in Pakistan, a move which helped security agencies foil the terror bid. They snatched the cop's phone before pushing him off his vehicle near Pathankot in the wee hours of Friday. Though the militants had knowledge about the air base, but did not know the location of parked aircraft like MiG-21 and Mi fighter choppers. They may be successful in entering the airbase but entered the kitchen area. However, they succeeded in transporting enough arms and ammunition to engage security forces for nearly 13 hours. Highly-placed sources told Mail Today that the terrorists made three calls from the cop's phone to speak to their handlers in Pakistan. The phone, according to Punjab police sources, was immediately put on surveillance after Singh reported the matter to the police. The police intercepted the calls which were made on Friday night. The fourth call was made by one of the slain terrorists to his mother. Sources said he informed his mother that he was on a fidayeen mission and she asked him to eat food before launching the attack. The police have not shared intercepts of the telephone conversations due to security reasons. Sources said the terrorists and their handles communicated in Punjabi dialect. The handlers also rebuked the militants for releasing the senior cop unharmed.  Sources said National Security Advisor Ajit Doval held a meeting with security officials soon after the calls were intercepted. A warning was issued and Indian Army and National Security Guard teams were asked to move to Pathankot by air. The teams were deployed at important places to thwart the terror attack. Despite the alert and security arrangement, the terrorists managed to enter the air force station using the escape routes. While some sources say the terrorists scaled the 12 ft high boundary wall which protects the air force station, some said the terrorists dug up a fence and entered the station.

ATTACK-EXPERTS 2 LAST : PTI feed, News - India TodayMaj Gen (retd) Ashok Mehta favoured a meeting between the Maj Gen (retd) Ashok Mehta favoured a meeting between the National Security Advisors of India and Pakistan.  "In fact, the NSAs should be talking to each other and discuss whether we will continue the talks. We need clarifications and these clarifications can only come through engagement," he said.  Retired Maj Gen Gagandeep Bakshi said in a Facebook post that he feared such an incident after the Prime Ministers of the two countries met last month.  "Just a week after PM Modis impulsive and high-risk mission to Pakistan to try to desperately seek peace, the Pakistani backstab has come even sooner than we expected in the form of the attack on the Pathankot air base.  "We did not give a massive mandate to the BJP to go back on its words and fare worse than the UPA in dealing with Pakistan," he said.  Defence Expert Uday Bhaskar said this attack from Pakistan comes at a time when two nations are moving closer. "We have seen this in the past during the tenure of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Whenever we move closer, such attacks take place and dialogue process goes on a back burner," he said.  Another Defence Expert P M Hoon said Pakistan was not "trustworthy", while Kamar Agha said the attack was aimed at derailing the talks between Foreign Secretaries of the two countries scheduled later this month.  "The efforts of Prime Minister Modi had raised hopes for dialogue process to get going and this attack is only meant to derail it," Agha said.

Former Indian Air Force officer Ranjith's role suspected in Pathankot web : Mail Today, News - India TodayFormer Indian Air Force officer Ranjith KK, who was arrested earlier for allegedly sharing classified information with Pakistan's intelligence agent, ISI, will be interrogated in connection with the Pathankot attack, crime branch officials told a city court. The court extended the ex-IAF officer's police custody till January 4. Ranjith was a leading aircraftman with the IAF and was posted at Bhatinda before he was dismissed and arrested following a joint operation by the Delhi Police's crime branch, military intelligence and the Air Force Liasoning Unit. Ranjith's police custody was extended by metropolitan magistrate Dheeraj Mittal, who accepted the submissions of the police that they wanted to interrogate him further. "In view of the allegation and the reasons thereof, the application is allowed. Police remand of the accused is extended till January 4," the magistrate said. The former IAF officer, who has been booked under the stringent Official Secrets Act, had allegedly shared secret information with intelligence operatives suspected to be backed by the ISI. Ranjith was honeytrapped into the espionage racket. A Crime Branch official informed court that revelations made by the accused need to be ascertained and he needed to be interrogated in connection with the Pathankot attack. The investigators' submissions came after the magistrate asked the police whether any disclosures and recoveries have been made during the earlier four-day remand. IO SS Sandhu said some revelations were made by Ranjith and police suspect that there could be a connection with the Pathankot attack. Police had earlier said in this case, Ranjith was deceived by a cyber entity named Damini McNaught, who pretended to be an executive of a UK-based media firm and claimed that she required air force-related information for an article in a news magazine from Ranjith in exchange for pecuniary benefits. Metropolitan Magistrate Punit Pahwa, on December 29, sent Ranjith, to police custody after the Delhi Police submitted that he was required to be taken outside the national Capital for interrogation. Seeking five days custody of the former IAF officer, the police said they had to take him to Jaisalmer and Gwalior.

Prime Minister  Narendra Modi  held a meeting tonight with top officials including National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar in Delhi even as questions were raised by defence experts over the way the encounter with heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists was handled by security agencies. Defence sources in Delhi said tonight that one terrorist was killed today while another was injured in the encounter that was on for nearly 43 hours, a day after four terrorists were eliminated after they struck yesterday. "The operation is still continuing and engagement with the terrorists is still going on, Air Commodore JS Dhamoon," Air Officer Commanding, Air Force Station Pathankot told a late evening news conference. "The operation will continue till the whole of air base is cleared of intruders and any terrorists," he said. Dhamoon said four terrorists have been killed and seven security men--one Garud commando, one NSG officer and five personnel of Defence Security Corps(DSC) have been martyred in the operation. Seventeen security personnel were also injured. Throughout the day, attack helicopters kept flying over the air force station to provide aerial support to the ground troops battling the terrorists who fired intermittently with the last round of exchanges erupting at around 9.30pm.   According to reports, the holed up militants were discovered in the forested area on the backside of the air base from where they are reported to have entered. Lt Col Niranjan, a member of the NSGs Bomb Disposal Squad and a Kerala resident, died after he succumbed to injuries which he sustained while he was trying to retrieve a live grenade from the body of a dead terrorist at the scene of the terror attack as part of the combing operations that continued through last night. Four other security men were also injured in this explosion. Three Defence Security Corps (DSC) personnel also succumbed to injuries at the hospital here during the intervening night of January 2 and 3. A Garud commando and two members of the DSC were killed in the gunbattle yesterday at the air base, located barely 35 km from the Indo-Pak border. "We are sure that still there are at least two more terrorists as firing have come from two different places. But we are not sure whether there are some more. We will come to know the number of terrorists only after the completion of the operation and body count," Union Home Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi told a press conference in Delhi. The comments by Mehrishi came a day after Home Minister  Rajnath Singh  tweeted saying the operation had been completed with the killing of five terrorists. Singh later deleted his tweet. During the day, five companies of army along with JCB bulldozers were sent to the area to speed up the operation against the terrorists. Former Western Air Command Chief Air Marshal P S Ahulwalia said casualties could have been kept at minimum through "effective coordination" adding the time taken to neutralise the attackers is way "too long".

Asha Parekh lobbied for Padma Bhushan, says Gadkari : PTI feed, News - India TodayNagpur, Jan 3 (PTI) Union minister  Nitin Gadkari  has said that veteran Bollywood actress Asha Parekh had approched him seeking recommendation for Padma Bhushan award and that many others have been "chasing" him as they want the highest civilian honours.  He said giving away Padma awards has become a "headache" these days.  "Asha Parekh had come to me seeking recommendation for the prestigious Padma Bhushan award, saying that she was entitled to it," Gadkari said at a function here last night.  The Minister said that he was being "chased" for such recommendations.  "(We) receive so many letters for (recommending) Padmashree and Padma Bhushan. I have sent around thousand recommendations until now. So many people now want Padmashree and Padma Bhushan.  "One actress met me, she has turned old...Asha Parekh. She came to meet me in Mumbai. The lift to my residence was not working, she climbed up 12 floors, I felt very bad. I asked her why she took the trouble.  "She said I have received Padmashree Nitinji, now I want Padma Bhushan. I said you have received Padmashree, it is like Padma Bhushan (only). She said no. She said she has done so many films. Asha Parekh is a big name truly but somewhere she felt that she should get Padma Bhushan."  The Padma Bhushan is the third highest civilian award after the Bharat Ratna and the Padma Vibhushan and comes before the Padmashree.  Gadkari claimed that Parekh had told him that she was entitled for the Padma Bhushan due to her massive contribution in Indian film industry.  Efforts to get Parekhs reaction did not fructify.  Parekh, 73, was honoured with Padmashree in 1992, and Lifetime Achievement award in 2014.

Pak needs to curb terrorist and other outfits: V K Singh : PTI feed, News - India TodayNew Delhi, Jan 3 (PTI) In the wake of terror attack at Pathankot Air Force base, Union Minister V K Singh today said Pakistan needs to check terrorist and other organisations acting against India, which is trying to improve bilateral ties.  The former Army chief said that the civilian government in Pakistan should be strengthened to help maintain friendly ties with the neighbouring country and take forward the hopes kindled among the common people of Pakistan after Prime Minister  Narendra Modi s recent visit there.  "In Pakistan, there are different agencies - there is an elected government, the Army and ISI, whose agenda probably is set by the Army or has its own agenda, and there are terrorist organisations. All have their different paths and work on them differently. The civilian government there has to be strengthened.  "The way after Modijis visit, hopes have been generated among the common people of Pakistan that there should be friendship and good ties between the two countries. This is a good thing and needs to be taken forward. But at the same time, the other things that I mentioned, there needs to be a curb on such things," the Minister of State for External Affairs said. He also lauded the way the security agencies foiled the terror attack and fought against terrorists in Pathankot.  Another Union Minister  Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi  said the government follows zero tolerance policy on terrorism and was committed to national security and would befittingly respond to any terrorist attack.  "India has given a clear message to all terrorists and their bosses that India is not at all tolerant towards terror. We do not compromise on issues which involve our national security," he said. Naqvi said, "We want that peace should prevail in the world, but if terrorist outfits want to thwart that peace process then they would be given a befitting reply by our security forces."

The terrorists were carrying Under Barrel Grenade Launchers, 52 mm mortars, AK rifles and GPS machine.  Based on intercepts, security agencies believe that one Nazeer from Bahawalpur in Pakistan was leading the group.  Defence sources said the terrorists sneaked into the nearly 2000-acre air base through a forested area where they were confronted by the Quick Reaction Team of Garud commandos.They managed to go up to 400 metres but were still 700 metres away from the area where the IAF aircraft fighters were stationed.

The Statesman: Pathankot attack: Rajnath withdraws tweet on terrorists' casualtiesUncertainty prevailed on Saturday night on the number of terrorists killed in the attack on the Pathankot air base, with Home Minister Rajnath Singh withdrawing a tweet putting the number at five.  "I congratulate our armed forces and other security forces on successfully neutralising all the five terrorists in 'Pathankot Operation'," Rajnath Singh had tweeted on Saturday evening.  The tweet was, however, withdrawn soon after. At the time of the initial tweet, the number of terrorists killed had been placed at four.Pathankot attack, Rajnath, Terrorist
The Statesman: Diplomatic spatThe surge of Islamist fundamentalism in the subcontinent has had an impact on diplomacy as 2016 unfolded. The current spat between Bangladesh and Pakistan goes beyond the usual tit-for-tat reprisals of South Asia. The crisis is embedded in what Dhaka calls Pakistan’s “audacious reactions” to the war crimes trial, more specifically the executions of some of those convicted for “collaborating” with Pakistani troops during the liberation struggle in 1971. It is a fair assumption that more are likely to follow considering the judiciary’s conceding the spirited demands of the post-liberation generation that was in the vanguard of the Shahbaug upheaval (2013). Thursday’s recall by Bangladesh of its High Commissioner in Islamabad, Suhrab Hossain -who has been asked to “return home in the quickest possible time” -has deepened the crisis with Pakistan. unreconciled to the loss of its eastern wing. This has been a festering irritant in the Pakistan military’s perception of geopolitics. Markedly, Dhaka has effected the recall at the highest level of representation. The circumstances of the withdrawal do have a bearing on theocratic violence; it comes barely a week after the furore over a Pakistani diplomat’s suspected connections with Islamist militants in Bangladesh. The Second Secretary in Pakistan’s High Commission in Dhaka, Fareena Arshad, had to pack her bags after the Awami government demanded her withdrawal when an arrested operative of the outlawed Jamaataul Mujahideen Bangladesh confessed that she had links to the outfit.  The diplomatic imbroglio is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon. Pakistan’s prompt denial of Fareena’s links with any terrorist group was only to be anticipated; but suspicions that the Jamaat in Dhaka operates in cahoots with Pakistan are not unfounded. Nor for that matter is the spat unrelated to Begum Khaleda contesting the claim over the number of martyrs of 1971, a statement after 45 years that was quite obviously addressed to the Pakistan gallery on the anniversary of liberation.  Ergo, Thursday’s award of death sentence to two students -belonging to the outlawed Ansarullah Bangla Team -for the killing of the secular activist, Ahmed Rajib Haidar, is more than sheer coincidence. It was the first of a series of brutal killings of secular bloggers who tend to have adopted the ISIS strategy of hacking. The sentence that that “the two shall be hanged by the neck until they are dead” may not contain militancy; it has nonetheless served to convey a message to the perpetrators of mortal fundamentalism that has since last February targeted what they call “atheist bloggers”. Bangladesh exemplifies a country where fundamentalist fury can impinge on foreign policy.   Islamist fundamentalism, Pakistan, Bangladesh, diplomacy
The Statesman: Timorous West and the ISIS threatViewed from a Western perspective, 2015 was defined by the predations of Isis. The year opened with killings in Paris, and it drew to a close with attacks on youth and pleasure in the same city. In between, Western tourists, many of them British, were gunned down in Tunisia; in Syria, what remained of the classical city Palmyra was ravaged; and a Russian tourist flight crashed in Sinai, believed to have been brought down by a bomb.  Each new atrocity prompted a fresh amplification of alarmist rhetoric. After the Tunisia attacks in June, David Cameron described the fight against Isis as the “struggle of our generation”, stating the terrorist group presented an “existential threat” to the West. When MPs voted to extend anti-Isis air strikes to Syria earlier this month, their speeches were peppered with references to fascism. Before the Russians sent their air force into action in Syria, President Putin called for a broad international alliance, such as the one that had defeated Hitler.  There was the inevitable fear of a fifth column, too. As many as 2,000 young Britons had become warriors or brides for the Isis cause, we were told – even though the number of jihadis remains proportionally tiny. The war had to be waged here as well – with travel bans, withdrawn passports, deterrent prison sentences, and millions more pounds for enhanced surveillance.  So we enter 2016 with the barbarians of our day at the gates, even within our city walls. But are they really? And what might it mean for UK and Western policy generally if they weren’t?  Take another look at the evidence. In the dying days of this year, Iraq’s apology for an army has managed to send Isis packing from the city of Ramadi (with Western air support, admittedly). The city was considered safe enough for the country’s Prime Minister to visit. Other Isis strongholds will probably be harder to spring. The biggest trophy would be Mosul, as it was when Isis overran it with such apparent ease 18 months ago. But that is to rush ahead.  The significance of one victory should not be exaggerated; it would be reckless to argue that the tide has turned, that the great sweep of Isis across the Middle East has been forced into reverse. Isis had held Ramadi only since May. But what has happened should give pause to all those who have peddled the idea of Isis as an all-conquering force – that “existential threat” – that must be fought with all our might.  How come Isis – or Islamic State, or Isil, or Daesh – has Western governments in such thrall? Some reasons were sound. There was the impressive speed of its advance over the past two years. There was the strength of its ideas. And there was the ruthless genius of its propaganda, which used modern technology to shock Western opinion by means of gruesome videos of beheadings. There was its offer, too – which appealed to some young Westerners – of a cause that demanded sacrifice, in return, perhaps, for an eternal reward.  Such a picture, however, ignores its weaknesses. The ideology behind Isis is medieval, even pre-medieval. Many of its ways are barbaric. Developed countries are happy to have left them behind; many others are fighting to do the same. Ancient and modern can only be combined so far. Is it realistic to believe – still less fear – that Isis will endure?  And how cohesive is Isis anyway? How wide its actual reach? Isis did not, in fact, claim the Charlie Hebdo massacre last January – a Yemeni al-Qaeda affiliate demanded the “honours” here. Does Isis have a command structure that is capable of directly ordering such atrocities as the Paris attacks? And what of the supposed groups subordinate to its authority in Libya, Tunisia, even Kenya? Perhaps the dreaded “Isis”, like al-Qaeda before it, is more of a label that extremist groups adopt to be feared in the timorous West?  Its fanatical ideology may not, importantly, even be its chief source of appeal. Isis prospered in Iraq, largely as a result of Western failures. The US and UK left widespread disorder after they toppled Saddam Hussein; Isis moved in offering security, albeit of a primitive kind. The US and UK dispossessed the once-dominant Sunnis; Isis offered them a way back. Similarly in Syria and elsewhere, the appeal of Isis, such as it is, reflects a quest for order and revenge quite as much as a religious idea.  Which suggests where the limits of Isis’s power might lie. If it cannot keep order, if it cannot delegate power when it moves on, then its authority may wane. Military force is not necessarily the key to its defeat, just as it was not the only key to its victory. When Mosul changed hands in 2014, it was reported to be largely by consent.    However, even if Isis is past its peak, the West is not out of the woods; nor indeed is Russia. So much of a bogeyman has Isis become, that it is now almost an indispensable component of foreign policy. It has given a host of outsiders a pretext for intervention in the Middle East – the real purpose of which is less to defeat this detestable, and still morphing, movement than to keep a stake in the unresolved power-play in the Middle East.  The fixation on Isis has directly damaging consequences: it blinds Western governments to regional shifts that could be even more problematic, such as the 30-year Sunni revolt. At home, it allows the UK and France to blame others for their patchy success in integrating a generation of Muslims.   Here are the barbarians we would have to invent if they did not exist. Isis is not the first monster enemy to be harnessed to the cause of flailing governments, but its defeat in Ramadi should encourage it to be seen with a new sense of proportion.

The Statesman: Security blanket over citySecurity arrangements were beefed up in Kolkata today following the attack on the Pathankot Air Base that took place in the wee hours of Saturday. Security has been tightened at railway stations, metro railways, heritage sites, central business district, NSCBI airport, IT sector at Rajarhat and Salt Lake.   Security has also been stepped up at NSCBI Airport.   Vehicles entering the car parking area are being checked thoroughly to prevent the possibility of car bombs. Security measures have been enhanced at the cargo terminal. Dog squad has been pressed into service in and around the terminal buildings. Passengers are being frisked, with even shoes being checked, while baggage is being x-rayed manually by security staff. Sniffer dogs were helping the police in checking baggage and passengers both at the domestic and international terminals.   Vigilance on the taxi stand outside the airport terminal has also been stepped up, airport officials said. CISF is providing comprehensive security to the terminal building and the runway.  Quick response teams of CISF personnel have been deployed at the new terminal building, a senior airport official said. Security of inflight catering service has been stepped up. Officials of Airports Authority of India (AAI), CISF and other units of the Bomb Assessment Committee including the Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad were carrying out a thorough search. Security at the main gate and the entry point of the airport has been tightened.  Security was also boosted at major locations in the city. Railway stations, airports and heritage sites are on high alert. "We have increased the security and constant patrolling and checking by sniffers dogs being conducted at major offices including Writers' Buildings, Nabanna, New secretariat and other places," a senior Lalabazar officer said.  Police made random checks at Victoria Memorial, Howrah Bridge, Vidya Sagar Setu.   "Moreover we have asked the shopping mall authorities to increase checking," the officer added.  Spokesperson of South Eastern Railway said more RPF personnel have been deployed on the platforms. CCTV installed at the platforms are under close watch. Checking by snifferes dogs is being conducted at regular intervals to sanitise the area, the official said.   Similar measures have been undertaken by the Eastern Railway authorities. While RPF personnel are keeping a close watch, more women RPF have also been deployed at the platforms.  A spokesperson of Metro Railway said, "Armed squads are present at each station, instead of two RPF officers, three officers are now present on each platform. A senior security officer along with his team have been scrutinising the entry and exit points of all stations.   Security has also been beefed up at the Barrackpore-Palta air force station, and the strategically important Hasimara airbase in Alipurduar since this morning, sources said. Security, CISF
The Statesman: Pathankot attack: PM Modi praises security forcesPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday praised the security forces for foiling a major terrorist attack at an Indian Air Force (IAF) base near Pathankot in Punjab.  "Proud of our Jawans and security forces," a tweet from PMO India quoted Modi as saying in Mysuru.  "Enemies of humanity who can't see India progress, such elements attacked in Pathankot but our security forces did not let them succeed," Modi added.  Five terrorists, suspected to be from Pakistan, were killed in a gunfight that lasted nearly 15 hours after they breached a high-security cordon and entered a frontline IAF base near Pathankot town in northern Punjab early on Saturday to carry out a fidayeen attack, police said.  At least three IAF personnel were killed and four others injured in the attack that began around 3.30 a.m. The counter-offensive lasted nearly 15 hours.Pathankot attack, Narendra Modi, security forces

The Statesman: From healthcare revolution to crisisFrom dawn, the queues grow. Several thousand of the walking wounded wait patiently, hoping to flee for Pakistan, India and Iran. Among the few perceived success stories of the American and British invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 was much-vaunted investment in health and education. But the long lines of Afghans outside embassies in Kabul last week paint a different picture, one of a nation in a healthcare crisis, rocked by a renewed Taliban threat.  In the face of attacks from the Taliban in Helmand and Kunduz provinces, many aid workers who provided a lifeline for thousands of Afghans have withdrawn. In Kunduz, the city where a US air strike hit a clinic run by Médecins Sans Frontières in October, the United Nations said aid workers were pulling back from the front line.  The Taliban is not the only threat. Isis, the jihadist group whose influence has extended beyond Iraq and Syria to Afghanistan, is now blocking government polio vaccinations across the country, telling residents that the Afghan government and the West are using health workers for “intelligence-gathering purposes”, or that the vaccine contains forbidden pork. The Afghan ministry of health said that around 100,000 children had not been vaccinated in 14 eastern and southern provinces because of the group’s threats. Afghanistan and Pakistan are the only nations where polio remains endemic. Only eight cases have been confirmed this year, compared with 108 in Pakistan. But on 28 December last year, two vaccination volunteers who were visiting a house in Kandahar — a woman and her teenage daughter — were shot dead. A local health official, Abdul Qayum Pukhla, said, “(It) was the last day of the campaign and as the workers were leaving a house, the gunmen opened fire and fled.”  Some of the most remote areas have been left with virtually no doctors, with healthcare workers unwilling to risk their safety for poor pay. “We have a district in Badakhshan, Ragh, which is the reason Afghanistan has the highest infant mortality rates in the world,” said Dr Nilofar Ibrahimi, a member of parliament from Badakhshan province and a gynaecologist. “This is a crisis. We have another district, Tagab, where 20,000 people have only a nurse. There is not a doctor there. The problem is corruption of the past 14 years and the lack of a vision. And then you have to think about lack of support for doctors — from salaries to insurance.”  Last year, a British government report on the UK’s progress in Afghanistan lauded healthcare success. More than half of the population had access to primary healthcare, compared with nine per cent in 2003, the report said. Maternal mortality had halved and life expectancy was at its “highest ever” level.  In Kijran, in Daykundi province, on the border of Helmand and Uruzgan, Bibi Khadijah, a mother of eight, was forced to travel for five hours by donkey to see a midwife when she gave birth to her youngest daughter. “I am one of the lucky ones,” she said. “For basic and simple diseases there are no doctors or medicine. When children have diarrhoea or chicken pox, we can’t get treatment.”  Security is only part of the problem in Afghanistan, and investment only part of the solution. “Investment in health has taken place. But this doesn’t help. Corruption was the reason for the problems in the health sector,” the chairman of the parliamentary health committee, Dr Enayat Ibrahimi, said. “There has been mismanagement in the past 14 years.”  An investigation by the US-based Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction has questioned where $210 million of US aid money to the Afghan ministry of public health has been spent, after coordinates provided by Usaid for the location of health clinics turned out to be empty.  Haji Baaz Mohammad, a 68-year-old farmer in the eastern province of Nuristan, where there are no government hospitals, despite funds being allocated for one in 2010, said, “There is only one surgeon in the entire province of at least half a million people. Our patients die on donkeys and mules on their way to Pakistan. Despite all the aid, people in Nuristan are dying because of lack of medicine and doctors.”  There are some success stories, however. Sixty-one-year-old Fatima Gailani has become a ray of hope for children, some of whom have less than six months to live. The children she helps suffer from a congenital heart defect, commonly referred to as a “hole in the heart”, and need surgery to survive. Their only hope is the money Gailani and her team are trying to raise at the Afghan Red Crescent compound in the modest Kabul neighbourhood of Afshar-e-Silo.  “There is increasing incidence of the disease in Afghanistan,” Gailani said. The daughter of a prominent Mujahideen leader, she spent much of her life in exile, and moved back to Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban. For her, the biggest challenge for the Afghan Red Crescent is raising funds. “There is this perception that people in Afghanistan are not willing to spend on a good cause. We wanted to change this perception,” she said, adding that the former President, Hamid Karzai, had called several prominent Afghan businessmen, asking them to donate. His successor, Ashraf Ghani, has asked the Indian ambassador in Kabul to facilitate the treatment of Afghan children in his country.  “The Afghan Red Crescent has managed to fund the treatment of 3,320 children since 2008,” Gailani said. “But there are 4,000 children still in need of care. Of these, 1,600 have six months or less to live if surgery is not carried out soon. We can’t afford delays. Afghanistan will have to help Afghanistan.”  Total casualty figures for Afghan security forces have not been published, but are said by Nato sources to be 28 per cent higher than in 2014, when the toll was around 5,000. The Afghan forces have had a tough year on the battlefield, having to fight the insurgents alone for the first time, following the draw down of international combat troops at the end of last year. The Taliban has used this to step up its offensives across the country.  The IndependentHealthcare, Afghan Red Crescent

The Statesman: Befriending PakistanFormer foreign secretary Muchkund Dubey has expressed the belief in his book that Pakistan might have been better off if it had followed Mohammed Ali Jinnah’s precept about adhering to secular norms.  Pakistani historian Ayesha Jalal maintains, however, in The Struggle for Pakistan, that ideologues of the new country ensured that “the governor-general, by now a dying man, was never allowed to speak again without a prepared script”.  If anything, her claim shows that not only were there elements in Pakistan who were more powerful than the Quaid-e-Azam right from the start, but also that their clout apparently emanated from their opposition to Jinnah’s “secular” views. Pakistan, therefore, can be said to have embarked on a jihadi path from the beginning. The stage was set, therefore, for India and Pakistan to follow their divergent paths of democratic secularism and authoritarian Islamism, leading to prolonged enmity.  But, as Dubey’s speculative comment shows, there is a greater eagerness in India than in Pakistan to wonder about what might have happened if Pakistan hadn’t pursued the path of implacable hostility towards this country and become the “epicentre” of terrorism in the process. Hence, perhaps, the high expectations of a permanent thaw whenever there is a diplomatic interaction between the two countries.  It is no different this time with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s flying visit to Lahore putting a seal on  the latest round of interactions which started with their two-minute powwow in Paris, which was followed by the  Bangkok talks between the Indian and Pakistani national security advisers and the Heart of Asia conference in Islamabad where external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj was present.  The hopes of a breakthrough appear to have seeped through to the other side as well with Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s advice to his ministers not to criticize India. The fact that Nawaz Sharif’s mother, Shamim Akhtar, described India as mere watan (my country) during a meeting with Sushma Swaraj because she was born near Amritsar underscores this point.  It is noteworthy that the expectations in this respect are markedly different from the low key popular responses which mark the Sino-Indian talks although, militarily, China poses a bigger threat. The impression with regard to the latter, which is also a neighbour, is that it is an unreliable bully which has to be kept at an arm’s length while India keeps its powder dry.  Dubey has dwelt on many of these aspects relating to the neighbourhood in his exhaustive analysis, but if the chapters on Pakistan attract greater attention, the reason perhaps is that the sense of India and Pakistan having once been one country influences all positive interactions even as the feeling of betrayal becomes overpowering whenever the relations take a nosedive.  The second aspect can be discerned in the increasing number of films that are being made on the theme of Indian spies “taking out” the  jihadi masterminds through clandestine strikes. There is a film, for instance, D-Company in which Dawood Ibrahim is nabbed and another,  Phantom, where Hafiz Saeed is killed. There is a third, Baby, about a nascent intelligence outfit in which Indian secret agents kill a Pakistani terrorist in a third country and kidnap another. Since Bollywood often reflects the popular mood, the films carry a message.  In Baby, the secret agents make use of a local “deep asset”. It is worth recalling that these “assets” were neutralized by I.K. Gujral when he was Prime Minister, as has been claimed by defence minister Manohar Parrikar. Dubey says, however, that Gujral had an “enlightened” attitude towards neighbours.  Whether or not Pakistan deserved the benefit of such an attitude, the nostalgia on this side of the border about the past togetherness of the two countries can be said to have given the Pakistan army an opportunity to stoke apprehensions about India’s designs to re-enact the earlier unity by destroying today’s Pakistan. After all, India’s first President, Rajendra Prasad, said soon the Partition that “let us hope and pray that the day will come when even those who have insisted upon and brought about this division will realise India’s essential oneness and we shall be united once again”.  As an antidote to this possibility and to distance Pakistan from secular India, the Pakistan army and the political establishment have tried to bolster the country’s Islamic identity. In doing so, however, they seem to have trapped themselves in a situation where the close connections between Islam and terror has given Pakistan a bad name where the international community is concerned. Arguably, the Manmohan Singh government’s idea about the borders between the two countries fading away, especially in Kashmir  — which had Pervez Musharraf’s approval - might have paved the way for peace but for the spectre of terrorists to whom an open border will be an irresistible invitation to create mayhem in Kashmir and elsewhere.    However, the problem for the Pakistan army is that its coddling of the “snakes” in the country’s backyard, as Hillary Clinton described the terrorists, has led to a situation where the military is unable to keep a lid on the jihadis. Dubey quotes a Pakistani journalist, Nadir Hassan, as saying that “we are not about to launch operations against every militant group in the country for the simple reason that we can’t. Doing so would require sending the army into every city of Pakistan, to aerially bombard every major urban area. It should go without saying that this is something no one wants”.   What is shocking is that the army’s hands-off approach continued even after the massacre in a Peshawar school with its anti-terrorism offensive being directed mainly at Uzbek and Tajik militants and not the Pakistani perpetrators of the crime. There is little doubt that Pakistan has not kept the promise of distinguishing between the anti-India “good” terrorists like the Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM), and the anti-Pakistan “bad” terrorists like the Tehreek-e-Taliban.    Does the resumption of dialogue have a better chance of success this time ? It all depends on what the Pakistan army regards as a solution of the Kashmir imbroglio. It will not be pleased with an open border because that will mean that India will retain its political and military hold on the valley and adjoining areas which are under its control now. This means that, in the eyes of the Pakistan army, the unfinished business of the Partition will remain unfinished. Can Nawaz Sharif convince General Raheel Sharif that there is no other way?

The impression with regard to the latter, which is also a neighbour, is that it is an unreliable bully which has to be kept at an arm’s length while India keeps its powder dry.  Dubey has dwelt on many of these aspects relating to the neighbourhood in his exhaustive analysis, but if the chapters on Pakistan attract greater attention, the reason perhaps is that the sense of India and Pakistan having once been one country influences all positive interactions even as the feeling of betrayal becomes overpowering whenever the relations take a nosedive.  The second aspect can be discerned in the increasing number of films that are being made on the theme of Indian spies “taking out” the  jihadi masterminds through clandestine strikes. There is a film, for instance, D-Company in which Dawood Ibrahim is nabbed and another,  Phantom, where Hafiz Saeed is killed. There is a third, Baby, about a nascent intelligence outfit in which Indian secret agents kill a Pakistani terrorist in a third country and kidnap another. Since Bollywood often reflects the popular mood, the films carry a message.  In Baby, the secret agents make use of a local “deep asset”. It is worth recalling that these “assets” were neutralized by I.K. Gujral when he was Prime Minister, as has been claimed by defence minister Manohar Parrikar. Dubey says, however, that Gujral had an “enlightened” attitude towards neighbours.  Whether or not Pakistan deserved the benefit of such an attitude, the nostalgia on this side of the border about the past togetherness of the two countries can be said to have given the Pakistan army an opportunity to stoke apprehensions about India’s designs to re-enact the earlier unity by destroying today’s Pakistan. After all, India’s first President, Rajendra Prasad, said soon the Partition that “let us hope and pray that the day will come when even those who have insisted upon and brought about this division will realise India’s essential oneness and we shall be united once again”.  As an antidote to this possibility and to distance Pakistan from secular India, the Pakistan army and the political establishment have tried to bolster the country’s Islamic identity. In doing so, however, they seem to have trapped themselves in a situation where the close connections between Islam and terror has given Pakistan a bad name where the international community is concerned. Arguably, the Manmohan Singh government’s idea about the borders between the two countries fading away, especially in Kashmir  — which had Pervez Musharraf’s approval - might have paved the way for peace but for the spectre of terrorists to whom an open border will be an irresistible invitation to create mayhem in Kashmir and elsewhere.    However, the problem for the Pakistan army is that its coddling of the “snakes” in the country’s backyard, as Hillary Clinton described the terrorists, has led to a situation where the military is unable to keep a lid on the jihadis. Dubey quotes a Pakistani journalist, Nadir Hassan, as saying that “we are not about to launch operations against every militant group in the country for the simple reason that we can’t. Doing so would require sending the army into every city of Pakistan, to aerially bombard every major urban area. It should go without saying that this is something no one wants”.   What is shocking is that the army’s hands-off approach continued even after the massacre in a Peshawar school with its anti-terrorism offensive being directed mainly at Uzbek and Tajik militants and not the Pakistani perpetrators of the crime. There is little doubt that Pakistan has not kept the promise of distinguishing between the anti-India “good” terrorists like the Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM), and the anti-Pakistan “bad” terrorists like the Tehreek-e-Taliban.    Does the resumption of dialogue have a better chance of success this time ? It all depends on what the Pakistan army regards as a solution of the Kashmir imbroglio. It will not be pleased with an open border because that will mean that India will retain its political and military hold on the valley and adjoining areas which are under its control now. This means that, in the eyes of the Pakistan army, the unfinished business of the Partition will remain unfinished. Can Nawaz Sharif convince General Raheel Sharif that there is no other way?

The Statesman: Pathankot attack: Youth Congress members burn Sharif's effigyMadhya Pradesh Youth Congress on Saturday burnt an effigy of Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to protest the Pathankot Air Force base terror attack in Punjab, suspected to have been carried out by members of an outfit based in the neighbouring country.  Youth Congress activists led by their state chief Kunal Choudhary burnt the effigy of Pakistan PM here to vent their anger against the terror strike, in which three security men were killed.  Choudhary criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi stating that the PM chose to pay a surprise visit to Lahore last month despite knowing that Pakistan had been sponsoring terrorism in India.  Modi should have taken lessons from a former Prime Minister who had visited Pakistan but the neighbouring country hit back at India with Kargil war and attacks on Akshardham and Parliament, he said in a press release.  State Youth Congress spokesperson Syed Saud Hasan said Pakistan had always betrayed India and Modi should keep this in mind before deciding to visit the country next time.  Heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists today attempted to storm the Pathankot Air Force base triggering a day-long gun battle in which three security men and four infiltrators were killed.  There was speculation that the attackers may belong to Jaish-e-Mohammad, a Pakistan-based terror outfit.Pathankot attack, Youth Congress
The Statesman: Search operation continues at Pathankot air baseA day after terrorists attacked the Indian Air Force (IAF) frontier base near Pathankot town, search and combing operation continued on Sunday.  At least four terrorists, suspected to be from Pakistan, were killed in a gunfight that lasted over 15 hours after they breached a high-security perimeter and entered the IAF base in northern Punjab early on Saturday to carry out a Fidayeen attack.  Security agencies including the army, National Security Guards (NSG), Air Force, para-military forces and Punjab Police were involved in the massive search operation inside the IAF base and nearby areas.  IAF helicopters could be seen flying over the base and nearby areas through the night and since early morning on Sunday to assist ground forces in the search and combing operations.  "The search ops are continuing. Everything is being looked at minutely. The operation will end only after this is completed," a senior Punjab Police officer said.  Security agencies were particularly investigating the local support that the terrorists got in the area after entering Indian territory from the border belt with Pakistan on December 30-31. The Pakistan border is about 30 kms from here.  "The Innova taxi that the terrorists used to travel towards Pathankot from the border areas is suspected to have been booked through a call made from a Pakistani number. This is being investigated," the official said.  The taxi driver, Ikgaar Singh, 24, was killed by the terrorists on Friday by slitting his throat.  The terrorists had then hijacked the Mahindra XUV car of superintendent of police Salwinder Singh and slit the throat of his friend Rajesh Kumar.  Senior officials of the Army, Air Force, para-military forces and the Punjab Police were supervising the search operations since Saturday after the security forces neutralized the terrorists.  At least three IAF security personnel, including an IAF Garud commando, were killed and four others were injured in the attack that started around 3.30 a.m. The counter offensive lasted over 15 hours.  "We have also lost security personnel in the Pathankot attack. My heartfelt condolences to their families. We can never forget their sacrifice," Home Minister Rajnath Singh tweeted on Saturday.  A fierce gunfight between the terrorists, believed to be from Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM), and security forces had continued through Saturday after the terrorists entered the IAF base, located around 250 km from Chandigarh.  At the IAF base, MIG-21 Bison fighter jets, MI-35 attack helicopters, missiles and other critical assets were secure and the terrorists were prevented from getting near the technical area where the assets were stationed, IAF sources said.  The IAF, in a statement in New Delhi, said the terrorists' plan to destroy "valuable assets" was "foiled" due to "effective preparations" and "coordinated efforts".  National Security Guard (NSG) commandos, who had been rushed to Pathankot on Friday following apprehension of an attack, IAF's Garud commandos and army commandos led the counter-attack on Saturday against the terrorists.Pathankot air base, terror
The Statesman: Gunshots, blast heard again inside Pathankot air baseGunshots and a blast were heard from the Indian Air Force (IAF) frontier base near Pathankot town on Sunday morning leading to speculation that one more terrorist could still be holed up inside.  While four terrorists, who carried out a Fidayeen attack at the IAF base on Saturday, were killed by security agencies during a gunfight that lasted for 15-hours. There were confusing reports about the fifth terrorist being killed.  The gunshots and blast were heard on Sunday morning during search and combing operation inside the base, the IAF and Punjab Police sources said.  The technical area, where the IAF's MIG-21 fighter jets, MI-35 attack helicopters and other critical assets were stationed, was secure, they said.  A thorough search and combing operation continued at the Indian Air Force (IAF) frontier base near Pathankot town on Sunday following Saturday's terror attack.  Security agencies, including the Army, National Security Guards (NSG), Indian Air Force, para-military forces and Punjab Police were involved in the massive search operation inside the IAF base and nearby areas.  IAF helicopters could be seen flying over the base and nearby areas through the night and since early Sunday to assist ground forces in the operations.  "The search ops are continuing. Everything is being looked at minutely. The operation will end only after this is completed," a senior Punjab Police officer said.

At least four terrorists, suspected to be from Pakistan, were killed in a gunfight that lasted over 15 hours after they breached a high-security perimeter and entered the IAF base in northern Punjab early on Saturday to carry out a Fidayeen attack.  Uncertainty prevailed on the number of terrorists being killed in the attack on the Pathankot air base, with Home Minister Rajnath Singh withdrawing a tweet putting the number at five.  "I congratulate our armed forces and security forces on successfully neutralising all the five terrorists in 'Pathankot Operation'," Rajnath Singh had tweeted on Saturday evening.  The tweet was, however, withdrawn soon after. At the time of the initial tweet, the number of terrorists being killed was placed at four.Gunshots, blast, Pathankot air base
The Statesman: US condemns attack on Indian air baseStrongly condemning the "heinous" terrorist attack on an Indian Air Force base at Pathankot, the US has reaffirmed its commitment to its strong partnership with the Indian government to combat terrorism.  It has also urged all countries in the region to work together to disrupt and dismantle terrorist networks and bring the perpetrators to justice.  "The United States strongly condemns the terrorist attack on an air force base in the Indian state of Punjab on January 2," US State Department spokesperson John Kirby said in a press statement.  "We extend our condolences to the victims and their families," he said. "The United States is committed to our strong partnership with the Indian government to combat terrorism."  "We urge all countries in the region to work together to disrupt and dismantle terrorist networks and to bring to justice the perpetrators of this heinous act," Kirby said.  At least four terrorists, suspected to be from Pakistan, were killed in a gunfight that lasted over 15 hours after they breached a high-security perimeter and entered the IAF base in northern Punjab early Saturday to carry out the attack.US, condemns, attack, Indian Air Force base
The Statesman: Pathankot attack should not derail peace talks: ExpertsThe terror attack at the Pathankot air base may have raised questions on the about-to-be-resumed official dialogue between India and Pakistan, but experts say the best response to such incidents would be to continue the peace process that has just begun.  India has long maintained terror originating from across the border should stop for the peace talks to deliver. However, the recently resumed dialogue process, and the surprise visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Pakistan on his counterpart, Nawaz Sharif's birthday, appeared to write new chapters in the annals of bilateral diplomacy.  The attack at the frontline Indian Air Force (IAF) base in northern Punjab, around 30 km from the international border, coming within days of Modi's maiden visit to Pakistan, might have made a dent, but the balanced response from both the countries have raised hopes. The five terrorists who staged the attack were killed in a gunbattle that lasted for 15 hours. Three Indian security personnel were also killed.  Pakistan immediately condemned the attack and expressed its commitment to partner with India to eradicate terrorism. Indian Home Minister Rajnath Singh, while stating that terror will be given a "befitting reply", added that India wants peace.  Former Indian Army chief, General V.P. Malik, described the attack as "minor" and said it was unlikely to disrupt the dialogue process. He also said that following Prime Minister Modi's visit to Lahore, the stakes are high as the blame or credit will go completely to him.  "We must look at the prime minister's visit as a strategic engagement; with one engagement everything cannot fall in place," General Malik said, adding: "The second thing is that this particular event is a minor one; so its impact on the dialogue process will not be much."  The former army chief also said that the attack could not have been planned following Modi's Pakistan visit. "Such attacks are planned months in advance..." he said.  Stressing on the requirement of the dialogue process, General Malik said: "At the moment what has happened is that the prime minister's personal involvement is at stake... Earlier we could blame the foreign policy, but now fingers will only be pointed at him."  Happymon Jacob, Associate Professor of Disarmament Studies in Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), said that the talks should be continued not only along the formal lines but also through back channels to counter the menace of terrorism.  "Every time a dialogue process is started between India and Pakistan something happens, and this time is no exception. It shows militant organisations on that side are not happy with the dialogue," Jacob said.  "India should respond to this attack by enhancing surveillance and defence capabilities and at the same time not calling off the talks," Jacob said.  Stressing on the need for back channel talks, he said: "There should be back channel talks with the Pakistan Army and ISI as well... Now that they have taken up this ambitious dialogue, it should be concluded."  From the other side of the border, Yaqoob Khan Bangash, a history professor at Lahore's Information Technology University, spoke on similar lines, adding that India accepts that the Pakistani state is not behind terror attacks.  "I don't think the Indian side is going to withdraw from the dialogue process. The Indian side has accepted Pakistan's argument that all terrorist attacks are not from the Pakistani state. If India had not recognised this argument, they would not have gone forward with the talks," Bangash said on the phone from Lahore.  Bangash said the Pakistan Army is largely on board the peace talks, adding that continuing the dialogue will be the best reply to the terrorists.  "There is a constituency in Pakistan that does not want India-Pakistan peace, but the two governments should not bow down to these entities. If we stop talking, it will encourage them".  "The government of India should strengthen the hand of Pakistan in fighting terror. The Indian government knows the political government is in support of peace with India," Bangash said, addding that the two countries should share intelligence.  Bangash also said that Modi's Pakistan visit had a huge positive impact. That will be one of the factors pushing forward the talks.  "Modi's visit to Lahore changed the scenario quite a bit. He has shown he is a statesman," Bangash added.Pathankot, attack, peace talks
The Statesman: Pathankot attack: Six security personnel martyredAn Improvised Explosive Device (IED) exploded during the combing operation at the Air Force base here even as three security personnel injured in the terror attack by Pakistani terrorists succumbed to injuries, taking the death toll of security men killed in the attack to six.  While all the four attackers were killed in the day-long gunbattle on Saturday, three security men were also killed in the operation.  Three more Defence Security Corps personnel succumbed to injuries in hospital at night, Defence Ministry sources said on Sunday. Nine other security personnel including a Garud Commando are recuperating in hospital.  The IED planted by the terrorists exploded during the combing operations that continued through the night after heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists attempted to storm the Air Force base on Saturday.  A team of NIA took over the probe into the terror attack.  "The operation is going on at Air Force Station," SHO Sukhjinder Singh told reporters.  The NIA has taken over the probe into the terror attack.  Some senior officials of Punjab Police led by DGP Suresh Arora were also present at the base.  Entire area has been cordoned off and top officers of several agencies are camping in the station premises to oversee the operation which is jointly being conducted by several security wings including NIA, NSG and Garud.  A Punjab Police official said the operation will end only after a thorough search and combing operation is completed.  IAF helicopters were also seen flying over the base and nearby areas to assist ground forces in the operations.  In the heavy exchange of fire yesterday, a commando and two other personnel of the IAF were killed along with four attackers. At least, six security men were also injured.

The Statesman: NSG commando killed, death toll of securitymen reaches 7A fresh grenade blast ripped through the air force base here on Sunday morning claiming the life of an NSG commando, as three other security men succumbed to injuries in a hospital after Saturday's terror attack taking the toll of Indian security personnel to seven.  Lt Col Niranjan, a member of the NSG's Bomb Disposal Squad, was killed while he was defusing the grenade at the scene of the terror attack as part of the combing operations that continued through the night. Four other security men were also injured in the blast.  Defence sources said Niranjan, a resident of Kerala, was killed while trying to retrieve the grenade from the body of a dead terrorist.  Three members of the Defence Security Corps (DSC) succumbed to injuries in the hospital here during the night.  Four attackers, a Garud commando and three DSC were killed on Saturday when heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists had attempted to storm the base, triggering a day-long gunbattle at the airbase, barely 35 kms from the Indo-Pak border.  Among those battling for their lives in the hospital are 8 DSC personnel and a Garud commando.  Meanwhile, the joint combing operation was still underway, a police official said, adding that the NIA had taken over the probe into the terror incident. Some senior officials of the Punjab Police led by DGP Suresh Arora are also present here.   The official said the operation will end only after a thorough search, going on inside the IAF base and nearby areas, was completed.  Various security agencies, including the Army, Indian Air Force, Central forces and Punjab Police were involved in the joint operation.  A large cache of arms and ammunition have already been recovered during the sanitisation and search operations.  IAF helicopters were also seen flying over the base and nearby areas to assist the ground forces in the operations.  In the wee hours on Saturday, the group of terrorists in army fatigues had attempted to storm the base with the obvious intent of destroying MiG-21 fighter jets and MI-25 attack helicopters housed there.  The attackers were believed to have infiltrated from Pakistan and there was speculation that they may belong to Jaish-e-Mohammad headed Maulana Masood Azhar of the Kandahar hijack episode.  The terrorists were carrying Under Barrel Grenade Launchers, 52 mm mortars, AK rifles and GPS machine.  Based on intercepts, security agencies believe that one Nazeer from Bahawalpur in Pakistan was leading the group.  Defence sources said the terrorists sneaked into the nearly 2000-acre air base through a forested area where they were confronted by the Quick Reaction Team of Garud commandos. They managed to go up to 400 metres but were still 700 metres away from the area where the IAF aircraft fighters were stationed.

The Statesman: Bickram Ghosh disturbed by Pathankot attackCelebrated percussionist Bickram Ghosh called the terrorist attack in Pathankot on Saturday disturbing and asked people to shun violence.  "I feel distraught. I am disturbed. All I can do is ask people to shun the path of violence by listening to music which is so divine. This is what I can best do," the classical instrumentalist told PTI.  "From Paris to Pathankot, the news of such terror attacks disturb everyone... including an artiste like me. Would like to see an end to this. If anyone starts appreciating music, he will never become a terrorist," he said.  Four attackers, a Garud commando and three DSC were killed yesterday in Pathankot when heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists had attempted to storm the base, triggering a day-long gunbattle at the airbase, barely 35 kms from the Indo-Pak border.  A fresh grenade blast ripped through the air force base this morning claiming the life of an NSG commando, as three other security men succumbed to injuries in a hospital after yesterday's terror attack taking the toll of Indian security personnel to seven.  Bickram performed at the 'Chowdhury House Music Conference' last night. The four-day musical conference from January 1, an important date in city's classical musical calendar on the lines of Dover Lane, also witnessed performances of Tanmoy Bose, Dev Shankar-Jyoti Shankar (violin), Waseem Ahmed Khan (khayal) among others.Bickram Ghosh, Pathankot, terror attack

The Statesman: JeM militants suspected to be planning attacksTwo Jaish-e-Mohammed militants were suspected to have sneaked into the national capital and were planning high profile attacks, including taking hostages, following which security was on Sunday stepped up in the city, a day after the Pathankot air base strike by the same Pakistan- based outfit.  Delhi Police received specific intelligence input about the presence of militants. Police Commissioner BS Bassi on Sunday held a meeting with its top brass and the department sought help of central paramilitary forces in providing security, especially around vital installations in the city, said a senior police official.  "We have inputs regarding two Jaish-e-Mohammed key members who have sneaked into Delhi and are suspected to be planning high profile attacks or hostage crisis.  "We have also got a few additional companies of paramilitary forces to increase security following the alert," said the official.JeM, Delhi Police, BS Bassi, militants, Pakistan
The Statesman: Step up security along Punjab border: BadalRocked by two terror strikes in less than six months, Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal on Sunday urged the Centre to step up security along the state border and announced the setting up of the state government’s own commando force.  Talking to reporters here, a visibly perturbed Badal said: “The BSF (Border Security Force) strength is not adequate. We need more (BSF) strength because this area is close to the border with Jammu and Kashmir.”  “Centre should increase security along the border in Punjab,” he added.  He vowed to step up vigilance all over the state and set up a new commando unit that will specialise in counter-terrorism operations.  “The Punjab government will set up a commando unit… we will deploy SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics) teams permanently at Pathankot bordering Jammu and Kashmir and the state police will form the second line of defence,” Badal said.  Around six heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists on Saturday attempted to storm the Indian Air Force (IAF) airbase in Pathankot, triggering a day-long gunbattle, barely 35 km from the India-Pakistan border.  While, four militants were killed in the operation on Saturday, two more are suspected to be holed up inside the airbase as the operation continues.  In a similar attack in July, 2015, heavily-armed terrorists in Army uniform fired at a moving bus and stormed a police station, killing six persons, including an SP, and injuring eight others in Gurdaspur bordering Pakistan.BSF, security, Punjab, Sukhbir Singh Badal

The Statesman: Pathankot attack: Sushma meets ex-envoys to PakistanExternal Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on Sunday held a meeting here with six former envoys to Pakistan in wake of the terror attack on the Indian Air Force base in Pathankot in which at least seven Indian security personnel were killed.  Those participating in the meet were TCA Raghavan, who retired as India's high commissioner to Pakistan last month, along with his predecessors Shyam Saran, Satindra Lambah, SS Menon, Satyadutt Pal, and Sharad Sabharwal, external affairs ministry sources said.  The meeting was held to discuss India's strategy vis-a-vis Pakistan following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's dramatic stopover in Lahore from Kabul to New Delhi on December 25 last year to meet his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif, it is learnt.  The sources, however, refrained from giving details of Sunday's meeting.  Saturday's Pathankot terror attack came barely days before the proposed foreign secretary-level talks in Islamabad in the middle of this month.  Modi's visit was the culmination of a series of diplomatic engagements between the two South Asian neighbours starting from November 30 last year when he had a seemingly impromptu meeting with Sharif at the Paris climate summit.  On December 6, Indian National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and his Pakistani counterpart Naseer Khan Janjua held a meeting in Bangkok which was also attended by the respective Foreign Secretaries S Jaishankar and Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry.  Two days later, Sushma Swaraj landed in Islamabad to attend the Heart of Asia conference which engages "heart of Asia" countries for a peaceful and stable Afghanistan.  On December 9, she told media persons there that Modi would visit Islamabad next year to attend the summit meeting of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. Following a courtesy call on Sharif, she held talks with his advisor on foreign affairs, Sartaj Aziz, during which it was agreed to begin a "comprehensive bilateral dialogue".Sushma Swaraj, Pathankot attack, Narendra Modi, Pakistan, Ajit Doval
The Statesman: NIA to register case in Pathankot terror strike on MondayThe National Investigation Agency (NIA), mandated to probe terror cases, will register a case on Monday to probe the conspiracy of Pakistan-based terrorist group, believed to be Jaish-e-Mohammed, behind the strike at the IAF base in Pathankot in Punjab.  A team of NIA was at the spot on Friday as per the standard operating procedure and today the Government decided to hand over the case to the NIA after taking concurrence from the Punjab government, official sources said.  The mandate of the NIA probe will include entry of the militants into India, killing of a taxi driver Ikagar Singh, kidnapping of Superintendent of Police-rank officer of Punjab Police, who was later released and entry into the IAF campus, the sources said.  They said the investigators will also try and ascertain the conspiracy that was hatched on the Pakistani soil by the terrorists and if possible find out the state and non-state actors in that country.  As per the standard operating procedure, an NIA team is rushed to the site of terror strike so that they can share their expertise as well as have first-hand information about the case, the sources said.  The NIA may also question or seek custodial interrogation of a sacked IAF personnel Ranjith KK, a Leading Air Craftman (LAC) with IAF posted at Bhatinda, who was arrested by Delhi Police for allegedly supplying information to ISI, the sources said.  The Pathankot IAF facility, located near the border with Pakistan, is the base of MiG-21 fighter planes and MI-25 attack helicopters of Air Force.  India recently gifted four such choppers to Afghanistan last month.National Investigation Agency (NIA), Jaish-e-Mohammed, Pathankot attack
The Statesman: Rajnath ignored Assam govt on Bangladesh border visit: GogoiUnion Home Minister Rajnath Singh's visit to areas in Assam's Barak Valley along the India-Bangladesh international border without taking the state government into confidence was "unfortunate" and in violation of the spirit of cooperative federalism, Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi said on Sunday.  "We welcome the union home minister's border visit. However, not taking the Assam government's representative along with him in spite of its request is a violation of the spirit of cooperative federalism and the NDA government's much vaunted rhetoric of Team India," Gogoi said.  Rajnath Singh reached Silchar on Sunday and visited the Steamerghat border outpost along the international border in Karimganj district.  While he was accompanied by union Sports Minister and state BJP chief Sarbananda Sonowal and a delegation of the All Assam Students' Union (AASU), there was no one from the state government.  Gogoi said the state government has an important role in safeguarding the border and hence the Assam government should have been taken into confidence for making the border visit more meaningful.  "Never before in my long political career, has the state government been ignored like this," he said.  Gogoi said Rajnath Singh's action was tantamount to negating the constitutional provisions where law and order is a state subject.  He said a request was made to accommodate Inspector General H.C. Nath as a state government representative.  "The request was turned down citing space constraints. However, in addition to the name of 13 people mentioned in the manifest, (BJP leaders) Himanta Biswa Sharma and Mahendra Singh were accommodated for the border visit.  "Taking political leaders and ignoring government officials to solve a problem where the state's interest is involved will not go down well. This also exposes partisan attitude of none other than the union home Minister," Gogoi said.  "Everybody knows law and order is a state subject and the Assam government is extending full cooperation to the central security agencies in guarding the international border along with checking infiltration," he added.Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi, Bangladesh border, Rajnath Singh
The Statesman: Delhi on high alert following Pathankot attackThe national capital was put on high alert in the wake of the Pathankot terror attack and intelligence inputs about a suspected terror strike by banned outfit Jaish-E-Mohammed, police sources said on Sunday.  "Terrorist outfit Jaish-E-Mohammed is planning to carry out an attack in the city," an intelligence source said.  Earlier, there were inputs that Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Jaipur, Bengaluru, Goa and Kolkata were on the radar of some terrorists groups.  In view of the inputs, Delhi Police Commissioner B.S. Bassi on Sunday organised a second consecutive meeting with officials, including the heads of the bomb disposal unit and the fire department.  On Saturday, Bassi had reviewed security arrangements in the city with Delhi Police officials including special commissioners and joint commissioners.  Sources said Bassi, in Sunday's meeting, asked officials to remain on high alert to avoid any untoward incident in the city.  He also directed officials to keep up the heightened security at the airport, railway stations, bus stands and other vital installations, the sources said.  Vigil was intensified in many areas, including popular market places, in south Delhi, central Delhi and the VIP movement zone in Lutyens' Delhi, a police official said.  The police chief appealed to the residents to remain vigilant about any suspicious person or thing and report immediately to the police.  "Citizens' vigil against suspicious persons/objects/activities is vital to counter terrorism. Report anything amiss (on) phone No.100 or helpline 1090," Bassi tweeted.Pathankot attack, Delhi, High alert
The Statesman: Azad accuses Pak of 'abetting' Pathankot attackCondemning the terror attack on the IAF base in Pathankot, senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad on Sunday accused Pakistan of "abetting" the attack and also questioned the "consistently inconsistent" Pakistan policy being pursued by NDA Government.  "It's a cowardly act of enemies of peace and humanity which are aided and abetted from the soil of Pakistan, and our security forces are capable enough to respond adequately and appropriately," Azad, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, said in a statement.  He further said though the time is not opportune to comment on the flip-flops and weak-kneed Pakistan policy of the NDA government, as our security forces are battling the terrorist assault at Pathankot airbase launched by anti-India forces from across the border, there remains a dire need to revisit the "wishy washy" and "consistently inconsistent" Pakistan policy being pursued by NDA government.  Azad called the attack dastardly and gruesome and said the act has been carried out by Pakistan-backed terrorists at the Pathankot air base in Punjab.  Coming down heavily on Pakistan and its "terror sponsoring" network, Azad said such "dastardly acts" are not going to "cow us down or shake our resolve as a nation to combat and counter the evil designs of terror spreading networks."  Expressing condolence to the families of the martyred soldiers, Azad said,"As the nation mourns the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, I stand in solidarity with the bereaved families in their hour of grief."   Pathankot attack, Congress, Pakistan

Terrorists' Design Can't Succeed In India: Mukhtar Abbas NaqviRampur (Uttar Pradesh):                              Extremists have realised that their designs would never succeed in India due to the "tough attitude" of Prime Minister Narendra Modi towards terror and the high morale of security forces for dealing with situations like the attack in Pathankot today, Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said. Also, amidst speculation as to what impact the attack today would have on the peace talks between India and Pakistan, the minister spoke of the "BJP government's policy of generating, maintaining and furthering very good relationship" with the neighbouring country. Pointing at the operation today by security forces following the terror strike in Pathankot, he said that the way the attack was "mercilessly crushed" shows that India is geared up to respond to such activities. "Militancy now has no wings to fly in India as they have been impressed fully by the Prime Minister's extremely tough handling of such elements. "Modi's fear very much exists in the minds of the activists of Islamic State", Mr Naqvi said as he claimed that the outfit tried to enter India but had to retreat due to Prime Minister Modi's "tough attitude on this count". The Minister of State for Minority Affairs, meanwhile, congratulated Indian Muslims for their patriotism, saying they "never lend their ear to ISIS and crushed those elements who tried to bring the outfit to India". Mr Naqvi said that the day would come when Pakistan shall be forced to hand over Lashkar-e-Taiba leader Hafiz Saeed and fugitive don Dawood Ibrahim due to the BJP government's policy of "generating, maintaining and furthering very good relationship with Pakistan". "This gesture of ours was proved by the recent visit of the Prime Minister and the much-friendly meetings (sic) with his Pakistan counterpart," he said. Turning to Samajwadi Party-ruled Uttar Pradesh, he said that "the Centre has sanctioned Rs 3,000 crore expecting that development in the real sense of the term would take place" in the state. He further averred confidently that the BJP would form the government in the state after the 2017 elections and not ally with any other party. He said the party has formulated its strategies for achieving that goal.

4 Israelis To Be Charged With Anti-Arab 'Terror': JusticeJerusalem, Undefined:                              Israeli prosecutors will file charges today against four Jews for their involvement in "severe terror against Arabs and their property", the justice ministry said. Security officials told AFP Saturday night the charges are linked to the July firebombing of a Palestinian home in the West Bank village of Duma, which resulted in the death of three members of the Dawabsha family. A statement from the justice ministry noted that two of the suspects, who will be charged at the Lod district court at 0730 GMT, were minors. Israel has been under heavy pressure to try those responsible for the attack, with rights groups questioning the delay in the case and contrasting it to the swift reaction often following Palestinian attacks. The Shin Bet internal security service has held suspects under administrative detention, denied some of the right to see a lawyer part of the time and used physical force during investigations. Supporters of the suspects -- religious extremists known as "hilltop youth" who oppose the "secular" Israeli state -- denounced those methods as torture. The Shin Bet denies using any illegal methods, and has stressed that the entire investigation was conducted under the supervision of State Attorney Yehuda Weinstein. Eighteen-month-old Ali Saad Dawabsha was killed and his parents fatally injured in the July 31 firebombing. His four-year-old brother was the sole survivor from the immediate family. A Star of David and the words "revenge" and "long live the Messiah" were spray-painted on a wall near the family's small house. The attack drew renewed attention to Jewish extremism and accusations Israel had not done enough to prevent such violence. The "hilltop youth" have been blamed for violence and vandalism targeting Palestinians, Christian holy sites and even Israeli military property. Palestinians have often highlighted the lack of progress in the case as among the causes of a wave of knife, gun and car-ramming attacks targeting Israelis that began on October 1.

Police Hunt For Gunman After Deadly Tel Aviv Pub AttackTel Aviv, Israel:                              Israeli security forces pressed a manhunt on Saturday for the Arab Israeli suspected of killing two people and wounding seven others at a Tel Aviv pub, with the motive still unknown. The New Year's Day shooting came amid a wave of Palestinian attacks on Israelis and days after the leader of the Islamic State (IS) group threatened the Jewish state with violence. Police partially lifted a gag order on Saturday, naming the suspected shooter as Nashaat Melhem, 31, from the Arab village of Arara in northern Israel. They distributed his picture and encouraged public vigilance, as a massive manhunt continued. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said there was a "strong possibility that this was a terrorist attack but we haven't ruled out criminal motives". Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took a cautious tone in Saturday evening remarks at the site of the shooting, refraining from defining it as anything beyond a murder. "There was a despicable murder here yesterday -- incomprehensible cruelty," he said after lighting a candle outside the pub.   "Young people, whose entire lives were ahead of them, the ages of my own children, were innocently sitting celebrating a birthday and were murdered in cold blood." Netanyahu noted that security forces were working "around the clock to apprehend the murderer."   The shooting has been condemned by the council of Arara, the suspect's hometown, which as well as by the head of the Joint List, which groups the main Arab parties in parliament. The premier praised "the condemnations of the crime from the Arab sector," while stressing he expected to hear such from "all Arab members of parliament." He noted the existence of Arab Israeli "enclaves in which there is no law enforcement and in which there is Islamist incitement, rampant crime and illegal weapons that are frequently fired at events such as weddings." He said he had formulated a plan to dramatically increase law enforcement in the Arab sector." "You can't say 'I'm an Israeli in my rights and a Palestinian in my duties' -- whoever wants to be an Israeli has to be one all the way, in rights and duties, and the first duty is to obey the country's law," he stressed. Arab Israelis are those who remained in the Jewish state after its 1948 creation, as well as their descendants. They account for more than 17 percent of the country's population. They often complain of discrimination in various fields, including building permits, infrastructure and education. ' Mental issues' Members of his family told media Melhem had been suffering mental issues, and had been imprisoned for attacking an Israeli soldier in what he said was an attempt at revenge over the death of a relative shot by police in 2006. Security camera footage from a nearby store showed a bespectacled young man with a backpack calmly pretending to shop before going to the exit, placing the backpack on a trolley, removing what looked like a submachine gun and opening fire in the street. One of those killed was identified by his father as Alon Bakal, a law and business student who was a manager at Simta, the pub that was targeted. Police named the second fatality as Shimon Ruimi from southern Israel. They issued a gag order on the investigation, as well as the one into the death of an Arab Israeli taxi driver found shot in north Tel Aviv a short while after the shooting rampage. They have refused to say whether the attacks were linked. In a recording released a week ago and attributed to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the secretive IS leader pledged to attack Israel. Baghdadi said IS has "not forgotten Palestine for a single moment". "And soon, soon with God's permission, you will hear the footsteps of the mujahedeen... We are getting closer to you day by day," he said. Meanwhile, in a wave of Palestinian attacks since October 1 -- including stabbings, car-rammings and gunfire targeting security forces and civilians -- 22 Israelis, an American and an Eritrean have been killed. At the same time, according to an AFP count, 138 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces, most while carrying out attacks on Israelis.

Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu Vows Crackdown On Arab Crime After Tel Aviv MurdersTel Aviv, Israel:                              Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced on Saturday the murder of two people in Tel Aviv by a shooter suspected of being an Arab Israeli, pledging a crackdown on crime in that community. A man police identified as Nashaat Melhem opened fire at a pub on Friday, killing the two and wounding seven others before fleeing. He remained at large late Saturday, with thousands of police searching for him. The shooting came amid a wave of Palestinian attacks on Israelis, and while police said there was a "strong possibility that this was a terrorist attack", Netanyahu did not define it as such. "There was a despicable murder here yesterday, incomprehensible cruelty", he said after lighting a candle outside the pub. The attack was condemned by the council of Arara, the suspect's hometown, as well as by the head of the Joint List, which groups parliament's main Arab parties. "I appreciate the condemnations of the crime from the Arab sector; I must say I expect all Arab members of parliament, without exception, to condemn the murder," the premier said. He noted the existence of "enclaves in which there is no law enforcement and in which there is Islamist incitement, rampant crime and illegal weapons that are frequently fired at events such as weddings. This era has ended." The premier said he had, along with law enforcement, formulated a plan to "dramatically increase law enforcement in the Arab sector".   "You can't say 'I'm an Israeli in my rights and a Palestinian in my duties'. Whoever wants to be an Israeli has to be one all the way, in rights and duties, and the first duty is to obey the country's law," he stressed. Arab Israelis are those who remained in the Jewish state after its 1948 creation, as well as their descendants. They account for more than 17 percent of the population.

They were suspected to be members of Jaish-e-Mohammad, a Pakistan-based terror group that had been inactive for the last few years. The security forces became wise to their plans after intercepting the calls they made from the phone of a Punjab police officer, whose car they had hijacked on Friday, to contact their handlers. The gun-battle started at 3.30 am on Saturday after the armed forces -- who had already secured the compound -- detected them with the help of aircraft using thermal imaging capability.

Without Intelligence, Pathankot Attack Could Have Been Worse: Rajnath SinghGuwahati:                              Home minister Rajnath Singh today said had there been no advance intelligence report, the  terror attack at Punjab's Pathankot  could have been much worse. "If not for intelligence reports, Pathankot attack could have been worse," said the minister, speaking in Assam. The security forces became wise to the plans of the attack on Friday, after intercepting calls made by the terrorists to their handlers in Pakistan. Thereafter, soldiers and National Security Guards commandos were deployed to protect all installations in Pathankote. Backed by attack helicopters and state-of-the-art equipment  -- including thermal imaging technology and mine-proof and bullet-proof armoured personnel carriers -- the security forces have been waging a pitched battle for the control of the base since 3.30 am on Saturday.   The advance information had helped protect the vital air force assets stationed at the base -- MiG-21 Bison fighters and Mi-35 attack helicopters. But  seven security personnel have been martyred in the line of duty. This afternoon, after nearly 40 hours of the attack, a fifth terrorist was neutralised by the security forces. While the total number of terrorists who infiltrated is not known, it is suspected that at least another could still be holed up inside the air base. The operations are still on.

Pathankot Attack: Martyred NSG Officer's Last Rites To Be Held In KeralaPalakkad:                              The body of an NSG officer, martyred in the operation at the Indian Air Force base in Punjab's Pathankot town, will be brought back to his hometown near Palakkad on Monday for the last rites, a relative said today.

Day After Pathankot Attack, Sushma Swaraj Holds Strategy Meet On PakistanNew Delhi:                              Foreign minister Sushma Swaraj met a group of diplomats today for what the ministry described as "diplomatic consultations on Pakistan strategy". The meeting was attended by, among others, S K Lambah, G Parthasarathy, Shyam Saran, Shivshankar Menon, Satyabrata Paul, Sharad Sabharwal and TCA Raghavan. Sources said though scheduled earlier, the meeting acquired a new dimension after Saturday's terror attack at Pathankot, where, 40 hours on, security forces are still engaging the terrorists. Government sources say the future of the dialogue will be decided in the next few days after a clear assessment of the Pathankot fallout and the extent to which the Pakistani establishment was involved. With the attack coming days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's unscheduled visit to Lahore, a debate is raging over the initiative to renew dialogue with Pakistan. While PM Modi's visit was the first by an Indian Prime Minister to Pakistan in more than a decade, every such visit, or even an initiative to renew ties, has been followed by a terror attack. The opposition Congress has already said India should reassess its position on the neighboring country. Former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir Omar Abdullah called the attack "the first major challenge to PM Modi's bold Pakistan gambit." Home Minister Rajnath Singh had said though India is keen on good ties with Pakistan, it will give a "fitting reply to terror attacks". His party, the BJP, said dialogues cannot be revoked due to "one attack" and accused Congress of "politicising" the Pathankote strike. "You cannot change your neighbour, you can change friends and therefore we must continue with the talks but talks have to be mainly on the issue of terrorism and that's what exactly India is doing," Union Minister Prakash Javadekar has said. Pakistan has condemned the attack. A statement from its foreign office said, "Building on the goodwill created during the recent high level contacts between the two countries, Pakistan remains committed to partner with India as well as other countries in the region to completely eradicate the menace of terrorism afflicting our region."

Omar Abdullah Attacks PM Modi Over Speech On Yoga During Pathankot AttackSrinagar:                              Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah today hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for talking about Yoga at a time when an  encounter with terrorists was raging on at Pathankot Air Base . "Business as usual is all well and good but a speech about Yoga while an encounter rages at an Air Base in #Pathankot seems totally out of sync," Mr Abdullah wrote on Twitter. He was referring to the Prime Minister's address at a Yoga conference in Karnataka. He also criticised the authorities in Punjab for not making emergency evacuation arrangements for injured soldiers at the scene of deadly suicide attack in Pathankot. "Really? A 24 hour long operation and we don't have any critical care ambulances for our brave soldiers?" he said. He was responding to reports that an injured NSG jawan was rushed to a hospital in a car. He also expressed condolences over the death of security force personnel in the Pathankot attack. "Sorry to hear about the deaths of our brave security force personnel in the #PathankotAttack. Prayers for the deceased & their families. RIP," he said.

India, Pak To Draw Dialogue Roadmap For Next 6 Months: Sartaj AzizIslamabad:                              Underlining that there is "visible improvement" in Indo-Pak ties, Pakistan has said the foreign secretaries of the two countries will meet on January 15 to draw up a roadmap for the next six months to carry forward the bilateral engagement. The Pakistan government will focus on the revival of peace process in Afghanistan and the consolidation of the process of improvement of relations with India, Prime Minister's Adviser on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz told Radio Pakistan. He said the Foreign Secretaries of the two countries will meet in Islamabad on January 15 to draw up a roadmap for the Bilateral Comprehensive Dialogue for the next six months. The dialogue will cover all issues, including Kashmir, Siachen and water, Mr Aziz said on Saturday. Talking about the policy of a peaceful neighbourhood, he said it ultimately paid back as there is "visible improvement" in relations with India and Afghanistan. Aziz asserted that economic revival, peaceful neighbourhood and non-interference in affairs of other countries is the cornerstone of Pakistan's foreign policy. Aziz' remarks came as Pakistani militants attacked an Air Force base in Pathankot yesterday. In a pre-dawn attack, a group of heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists, suspected to be belonging to Jaish-e-Mohammed outfit, struck at the Air Force base in Pathankot, leading to a fierce gun-battle. Pakistan has condemned the terror strike and asserted that building on the goodwill created during the recent high level contacts, it remained committed to partner India in tackling terrorism. The attack came just a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an unscheduled visit to Pakistan and met Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif with an aim of improving ties. The process of resumption of talks was set in motion after a meeting between Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan in Paris on November 30 on the sidelines of Climate Change Conference. The meet was followed by the national security advisers' meeting in Bangkok a week later following which External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj visited Pakistan to attend the Heart of Asia Conference.

Rajnath Singh Ignored Assam Government During Bangladesh Border Visit: Tarun GogoiGuwahati:                              Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh's visit to areas in Assam's Barak Valley along the India-Bangladesh international border without taking the state government into confidence was "unfortunate" and in violation of the spirit of cooperative federalism, Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi said on Sunday. "We welcome the union home minister's border visit. However, not taking the Assam government's representative along with him in spite of its request is a violation of the spirit of cooperative federalism and the NDA government's much vaunted rhetoric of Team India," Mr Gogoi said. Rajnath Singh reached Silchar on Sunday and visited the Steamerghat border outpost along the International Border in Karimganj district. While he was accompanied by union Sports Minister and state BJP Chief Sarbananda Sonowal and a delegation of the All Assam Students' Union (AASU), there was no one from the state government. Mr Gogoi said the state government has an important role in safeguarding the border and hence the Assam government should have been taken into confidence for making the border visit more meaningful. "Never before in my long political career, has the state government been ignored like this," he said. Mr Gogoi said Rajnath Singh's action was tantamount to negating the constitutional provisions where law and order is a state subject. He said a request was made to accommodate Inspector General HC Nath as a state government representative. "The request was turned down citing space constraints. However, in addition to the name of 13 people mentioned in the manifest, (BJP leaders) Himanta Biswa Sharma and Mahendra Singh were accommodated for the border visit. "Taking political leaders and ignoring government officials to solve a problem where the state's interest is involved will not go down well. This also exposes partisan attitude of none other than the union home Minister," Mr Gogoi said. "Everybody knows law and order is a state subject and the Assam government is extending full cooperation to the central security agencies in guarding the International Border along with checking infiltration," he added.                  Rajnath Singh,Assam,Tarun GogoiUnion Home Minister Rajnath Singh's visit to areas in Assam's Barak Valley along the India-Bangladesh international border without taking the state government into confidence was "unfortunate" and in violation of the spirit of cooperative federalism, Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi said on Sunday.
Hidden Cameras For 'Real Challenge' Of Delhi's Odd-Even FormulaNew Delhi:                              A day before its implementation on a full-fledged working day, the Delhi government on Sunday said that elaborate arrangements have been made to meet the "real challenge" as part of which volunteers will be using hidden cameras to take pictures of violators and additional police forces would be fielded to ensure its effective compliance. Delhi Transport Minister Gopal Rai yesterday held a coordination committee meeting which was attended by senior officers from Traffic Police, Delhi Police, civil defence force, Metro officials and other agency heads engaged in implementation of the ambitious car-rationing scheme, which came into force on January 1. The government's move to ask the volunteers, comprising civil defence personnel, NCC and NSS cadets to click pictures assumes significance as they were initially asked to focus on mindset change by resorting to polite tactics like handing out roses. "As we saw that on the first day of this pilot project, people came out with odd-numbered vehicles and on the second day Saturday, even-numbered vehicles plied on the capital roads. This itself is an indication that the mindset of people for environment is changing and I salute all Delhiites for this 2 days' success", Mr Rai said after the meeting. The government said that the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses would possibly ferry around 64 lakh commuters tomorrow onwards, much more than the usual figures, while Metro is expected to carry 32 lakh commuters against the previous data of 26 lakh daily. "Civil defence volunteers will be given mobile camera and hidden cameras to be used to track violators. Very strong monitoring would be resorted to and no soft approach would be taken. Additional 100 teams of traffic police will be fielded on roads to monitor," Mr Rai said. Mr Rai also mentioned that "a few people" want to ensure the failure of this scheme. "Today one person has written on my Twitter account that tomorrow some miscreants are being sent from Meerut, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to create chaos in Delhi's roads. I don't know how much truth lies there now but I have received such message for the first time only. So this shows that how some nervous people can stoop to such levels because of our success", Mr Rai said.                odd and even number plates,Delhi,Aam Aadmi Party,odd even car formula,Gopal Rai,Delhi pollution,Delhi air quality,AAPA day before its implementation on a full-fledged working day, the Delhi government today said that elaborate arrangements have been made to meet the "real challenge" as part of which volunteers will be using hidden cameras to take pictures of violators and additional police forces would be fielded to ensure its effective compliance.
Asha Parekh Lobbied For Padma Bhushan, Says Union Minister Nitin GadkariNagpur:                              Union Minister Nitin Gadkari has said that veteran actor Asha Parekh had approached him seeking recommendation for Padma Bhushan award and that many others have been "chasing" him as they want the highest civilian honours. He said giving away Padma awards has become a "headache" these days. "Asha Parekh had come to me seeking recommendation for the prestigious Padma Bhushan award, saying that she was entitled to it," Mr Gadkari said at a function in Nagpur last night. The minister said that he was being "chased" for such recommendations. "(We) receive so many letters for (recommending) Padmashree and Padma Bhushan. I have sent around thousand recommendations until now. So many people now want Padmashree and Padma Bhushan. "One actress met me, she has turned old...Asha Parekh. She came to meet me in Mumbai. The lift to my residence was not working, she climbed up 12 floors, I felt very bad. I asked her why she took the trouble. "She said I have received Padmashree Nitinji, now I want Padma Bhushan. I said you have received Padmashree, it is like Padma Bhushan (only). She said 'no'. She said she has done so many films. Asha Parekh is a big name truly but somewhere she felt that she should get Padma Bhushan." The Padma Bhushan is the third highest civilian award after the Bharat Ratna and the Padma Vibhushan and comes before the Padmashree. Mr Gadkari claimed that Ms Parekh had told him that she was entitled for the Padma Bhushan due to her massive contribution in Indian film industry. Efforts to get Ms Parekh's reaction did not fructify. Ms Parekh, 73, was honoured with Padmashree in 1992, and Lifetime Achievement award in 2014. She was one of the top stars in Hindi films from 1959 to 1973 and had worked with all top heroes of her time including Shammi Kapoor, Rajendra Kumar, Rajesh Khanna and others.

National Investigation Agency To Register Case In Pathankot Attack TomorrowNew Delhi:                              The National Investigation Agency (NIA), mandated to probe terror cases, will register a case tomorrow to probe the conspiracy of Pakistan-based terrorist group, believed to be Jaish-e-Mohammed, behind the strike at the Indian Air Force base in Pathankot in Punjab. A team of National Investigation Agency was at the spot on Saturday as per the standard operating procedure and today the government decided to hand over the case to the NIA after taking concurrence from the Punjab government, official sources said. The mandate of the NIA probe will include entry of the militants into India, killing of a taxi driver Ikagar Singh, kidnapping of Superintendent of Police-rank officer of Punjab Police, who was later released and entry into the Indian Air Force campus, the sources said. They said the investigators will also try and ascertain the conspiracy that was hatched on the Pakistani soil by the terrorists and if possible find out the state and non-state actors in that country. As per the standard operating procedure, an NIA team is rushed to the site of terror strike so that they can share their expertise as well as have first-hand information about the case, the sources said. The NIA may also question or seek custodial interrogation of a sacked Indian Air Force personnel Ranjith KK, a Leading Air Craftman (LAC) with Indian Air Force posted at Bhatinda, who was arrested by Delhi Police for allegedly supplying information to ISI, the sources said. The Pathankot IAF facility, located near the border with Pakistan, is the base of MiG-21 fighter planes and MI-25 attack helicopters of Air Force. India recently gifted four such choppers to Afghanistan last month.

Ghulam Nabi Azad Accuses Pakistan Of Abetting Pathankot AttackNew Delhi:                              Condemning the terror attack on the Indian Air Force (IAF) base in Pathankot, senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad today accused Pakistan of "abetting" the attack and also questioned the "consistently inconsistent" Pakistan policy being pursued by NDA government. "It's a cowardly act of enemies of peace and humanity which are aided and abetted from the soil of Pakistan, and our security forces are capable enough to respond adequately and appropriately," Mr Azad, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, said in a statement. He further said though the time is not opportune to comment on the flip-flops and weak-kneed Pakistan policy of the NDA government, as our security forces are battling the terrorist assault at Pathankot airbase launched by anti-India forces from across the border, there remains a dire need to revisit the "wishy washy" and "consistently inconsistent" Pakistan policy being pursued by NDA government. Mr Azad called the attack dastardly and gruesome and said the act has been carried out by Pakistan-backed terrorists at the Pathankot air base in Punjab. Coming down heavily on Pakistan and its "terror sponsoring" network, Mr Azad said such "dastardly acts" are not going to "cow us down or shake our resolve as a nation to combat and counter the evil designs of terror spreading networks." Expressing condolence to the families of the martyred soldiers, Mr Azad said, "As the nation mourns the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, I stand in solidarity with the bereaved families in their hour of grief."

Indian Consulate Targeted In Northern Afghanistan's Mazar-i-SharifKabul:                              The Indian consulate in Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif was attacked on Sunday night by unidentified gunmen who tried to storm the building. At least two of the four attackers have been killed by Afghan special forces. Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Vikas Swarup said that no Indian casualties had been reported. "Everybody is safe," B Sarkar, Consul General at the consulate said. The mission in the northern Afghan city is manned by three Indian personnel. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. Mr Sarkar said the shooting lasted for 20 minutes. "They shot from some adjacent building but nobody could enter the consulate." Muneer Ahmad Farhad, a spokesman for the Balkh province governor, said the attackers had hidden in a house near the consulate and struck after darkness fell.   He said the gunmen had tried to enter the consulate but had so far not been able to. "Right now our security forces are fighting them," he said. A local police spokesman in Mazar-i-Sharif, a city in the relatively tranquil province of Balkh, said security officials had cordoned off the area where sporadic gunshots were ringing out after a series of explosions. The consulate assault is the latest in a series of attacks on Indian targets in Afghanistan. Nine civilians, including seven children, were killed in August 2013 when suicide bombers targeted the Indian consulate in the main eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad, detonating an explosives-packed car. The incident comes as  Indian security forces are still trying to suppress an attack  on the  air base in Pathankot , near the border with Pakistan that has killed at least seven military personnel and wounded 20 others. It also came amid renewed efforts by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif to reduce longstanding tensions between the two countries.                indian consulate,Afghanistan,Indian consulate in Afghanistan,Mazar-i-Sharif,Balkh ProvinceThe Indian consulate in Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif was attacked on Sunday night by unidentified gunmen who tried to storm the building.

Operation Pathankot: All five terrorists killed after a fierce gunfight of nearly 15 hoursPATHANKOT: Heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists today attempted to storm the Air Force base here, triggering a day-long gunbattle in which three securitymen and all the five infiltrators were killed, days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's surprise stopover in Lahore.    With the obvious intention of destroying fighter jets and attack helicopters housed there, the group of terrorists in army fatigues attempted to storm the base which is barely 35 kms from the international border with   Pakistan  but failed to go beyond the outer periphery.    In heavy exchange of fire, a commando and two other personnel of the   IAF  were killed along with all the five attackers. At least, six security men were also injured.    "I congratulate our armed forces and other security forces on successfully neutralising all the five terrorists in 'Pathankot Operation'," Home Minister   Rajnath Singh  tweeted after about 16-hour-long operation.    Home Ministry sources said Singh tweeted after receipt of information that the operation was over.    The Prime Minister, who had taken a big political risk by going to Lahore, said in Mysuru that the attack was carried out by "enemies of humanity who can't see India progress".    He expressed pride in the security forces, saying they did not let the terrorists succeed.    The attackers were believed to have infiltrated from Pakistan and there was speculation that they may belong to Jaish-e-Mohammad headed Maulana Masood Azhar of the Kandahar hijack episode.    The terrorists, who are said to have infiltrated three days ago, launched the first ever attack on an Indian Air base at around 3.30 am, their obvious targets being MiG-21 fighter aircraft and MI-25 attack helicopters.    Rajnath Singh did not rule out the possibility of involvement of Pakistan-based JeM terror outfit in the attack.    "The case will be probed by the NIA but the possibility of JeM being behind the attack cannot be ruled out," he said.    In the wake of the attack, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar cut short his stay in Goa and returned to Delhi where he held a high level meeting which was attended by National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and three Service chiefs.    "Through timely and prompt action by all agencies, the likely plan of the terrorists to destroy valuable assets of the Air Force has been foiled," IAF said in a statement after the meeting.    The terrorists could not go beyond the 'langar' (eating place) near the outer perimeter of the IAF complex as the security forces were ready to take them on, officials said about the operation which was supervised directly by Doval.

Attack on Punjab airbase foiled, five Jaish men killed in 17-hour gunfightPathankot:  Just a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's dramatic touchdown in Lahore, Pakistani terrorists attacked the strategically vital air force base here on Saturday morning, highlighting the challenge and costs involved in the attempt to restore normalcy with the hostile neighbour .    The pre-dawn fidayeen raid by terrorists belonging to the Jaish-e-Muhammed led by Maulana Masood Azhar, seeking to enter the strategically crucial forward operating base - located barely 40km from the Indo-Pak border and at the strategic tri-junction of Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh - is home to a squadron of Mig-21 fighters and MI-25 and MI-35 attack helicopters. According to PTI reports, four MI-25 copters gifted by India to Afghanistan were from this base. The jihadis were asked by their handlers to specially destroy the aircraft and choppers. "Choppers aur planes ko uda do (blow up the planes and choppers)," said one of the calls from the handlers intercepted by intel agencies.     READ ALSO  Pathankot strike plotted by Pak army HQ?    At least five terrorists, one of them identified as Nasir Khan, were killed in an exchange of fire with commandos of the National Security Guards and Indian Air Force (IAF). Three security personnel, including one Air Force commando, were also killed in the operation, involving the use of attack helicopters, that started around 3.30am on Saturday and lasted about 17 tense hours, but the cantonment town, teeming with members of armed forces, was spared a big atrocity because of advance intelligence. A possible hostage crisis was averted by the timely action. Two of the slain defence personnel belonged to Gurdaspur.         READ ALSO  ​Agencies intercepted 4 calls by terrorists       Jihadis took orders from Pak handlers    The slain Punjabi-speaking terrorists, part of a Jaish group based in Pakistan's Bahawalpur, were taking instructions from their handlers Maulana Ashfaq and Haji Abdul Shaqur. The two owe their allegiance to Maulana Azhar, an old tormentor of India, who along with other Jaish terrorists had to be freed to secure the release of passengers on board the Indian Airlines plane which was hijacked in 1999 with the help of ISI.    Actionable inputs by intelligence agencies, including RAW, that jihadis were on the lookout for a spectacular attack on military targets, together with alarm sounded after they hijacked the vehicle of the Gurdaspur SP, had led the Centre to rush NSG commandos and ramp up security measures at the airbase stretched over 1600 acres.    While the terrorists did not succeed in entering the "technical area" where fighter aircraft and choppers - high-value assets in military parlance - were parked, their audacity underscored the need for caution in dealing with Pakistan. The latest attempt at peace by the governments in two countries is supposed to enjoy the support of the Pakistan army, the de facto centre of power, especially when it comes to the policy towards India and this immediately raised the question of whether the terrorists who struck at Pathankot had the support of the notorious Pak army-ISI nexus.     READ ALSO  Agencies got wind of attack on Friday itself    Jaish's own equations with the Pakistan army and ISI have waxed and waned over the years. It was one of the tools of Islambad's proxy war against India, and this was best evident when Azhar after his release was allowed to operate with impunity. Pakistan has baulked at executing Omar Sheikh, another terrorist belonging to the Deobandi group, who killed American journalist Daniel Pearl. However, it lost its status as ISI's chief arm to Lashkar. Equations further deteriorated after two failed assassination efforts on Pakistani dictator General Pervez Musharraf were traced to Jaish. Lately, however, it seemed to be creeping back into reckoning.    Though it is difficult for the Indian government to immediately assess the complicity of Pakistan's state actors in the attack, there were clear signs that the terror attack had once again underlined the political risks involved in the peace process and that the government would be pursuing the efforts even more cautiously. The sheer symbolism of a single damaged plane or chopper would have set PM Narendra Modi and BJP back severely.         READ ALSO  Punjab strike subjects PM's Pak policy to pol pressure test    The terrorists are believed to have entered India on Thursday night almost through the same route which the Gurdaspur attackers used in July last year: something which again highlighted the vulnerability of the region, especially during the winters when the passes in J&K freeze. They used a local taxi ordered by their handlers in Pakistan to travel some distance. They forced the driver to keep on moving even after one of the tyres had burst and killed him once the Innova taxi, with its rim damaged badly, could not carry on.    The gang then commandeered the vehicle of Gurdaspur SP Salwinder Singh, who was travelling with two companions. They let the officer, who was in his civvies, go and abandoned the SUV about two kilometres from the air force station from where the terrorists are believed to have walked to their target. The alarm raised by Singh about the presence of a group carrying AK- 47s tied in with the intercepts that intelligence agencies already possessed about the "high probability" of a terror attack on military installations in the region, leading to the deployment of NSG commandos and shoring up of security measures.    Senior Punjab police officials had alerted the air force station and other defence installations by Friday afternoon. However, the well-trained and highly motivated Jaish fidayeen who fired mortal shells to force their way into the base, managed to scale the high walls of the outer perimeter of the air force station and engage the soldiers.     READ ALSO   READ ALSO: Attack shadow likely over FS-level talks in Islamabad    The attack on the massive campus of the station which has residential complexes of the defence staff raised fears of a hostage crisis but the NSG commandos and others kept them contained in one corner with the help of attack helicopters constantly firing at them. After the attackers were killed, the sanitising operation with assault choppers and searchlights went on till midnight amid fears that there were more terrorists holed up in the bushes around the base.    An official statement from the IAF said the terrorists were detected by aerial surveillance platforms as soon as they entered the station. The infiltrators were immediately engaged and contained within a limited area, "thus preventing them from entering the technical zone where high value assets are parked". "Through timely and prompt action by all agencies, the likely plan of the terrorists to destroy valuable assets of the Air Force has been foiled," the statement said.    Like the attack on the Dinanagar police station in July, the fidayeens came heavily armed with the latest weapons. "This time they had mortar shells that are usually fired by troops across the border," said Punjab Police additional director general of police (ADGP) law and order Hardeep Dhillon, who supervised the operation. Throughout the operation, both Dhillon and Punjab Police chief Suresh Arora, remained in the Air Traffic Control (ATC) room alongside Western Command chief Air Marshal S B Deo.Just a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s dramatic touchdown in Lahore, Pakistani terrorists attacked the strategically vital air force base here on Saturday morning, highlighting the challenge and costs involved in the attempt to restore normalcy with the hostile neighbour.

Police custody of former IAF official extendedNEW DELHI, Jan 2: A Delhi court today remanded a former IAF official, arrested for allegedly sharing secret information with Pakistan’s ISI, to two more days of police custody to enable the agency to interrogate him in connection with the Pathankot terror attack.Metropolitan Magistrate Dheeraj Mittal allowed the custodial interrogation of Ranjith KK till January 4 after Delhi Police said that during his earlier questioning, he had made a lot of disclosures and revelations in connection with the Pathankot terror attack.The dismissed Air Force official allegedly shared secret information with intelligence operatives suspected to be backed by Pakistan’s ISI after being “honeytrapped” into an espionage racket.Ranjith KK, a Leading aircraft man with the Indian Air Force posted at Bhatinda, was dismissed recently and later arrested after a combined operation by Delhi Police’s Crime Branch, Military Intelligence and Air Force Liaisoning Unit (LU).He has been booked under provisions of the Official Secrets Act.The magistrate in its order said, “Accused is produced from police custody. Investigating Officer (IO) moved an application seeking extension of PC remand of the accused for two days. I have gone through the reasons mentioned in the application and heard the submission in this regard. In view of the allegation and the reasons thereof, the application is allowed. PC remand of the accused is extended till January 4.”During the brief hearing, the magistrate asked the IO whether any recovery or any disclosure has been made by the accused during the earlier four-day remand which ended today.Crime Branch IO S S Sandhu said that some revelations made by the accused in connection with the Pathankot terror attack and terror espionage needs to be ascertained for which his further interrogation is needed.The IO further said that some other disclosures were also made and the police is trying to ascertain the facts regarding the espionage racket.Police had earlier said that in this case, Ranjith was deceived by a cyber entity by the name Damini McNaught, who pretended to be the executive of a UK-based media firm, and claimed that she required Air Force-related information for an article in their news magazine from Ranjith in exchange for pecuniary benefits.Ranjith allegedly shared Air Force-related information, mostly pertaining to a recent exercise, movements of aircraft and deployment of various units, in exchange for money transferred to his bank account, police said.It said Ranjith allegedly shared secret information also through e-mails and Internet-based text messaging services. The documents he had shared now have to be analysed to evaluate the actual damage and potential threat to national security, police said.Police are trying to crack open the honeytrapping module and ascertain the identities of more security personnel associated with it.

Terrorists to be vanquished from Pakistan in 2016: Pakistan Army Chief General Raheel SharifKARACHI: Pakistan's powerful army chief Gen   Raheel Sharif  has vowed to rid the country from the scourge of terrorism, asserting that "all negative forces" would be scuttled.    "The new year will be the year when   terrorism  will end," he said yesterday while addressing tribal elders of Gwadar, Talar and Turbat areas of Makran division.    The new year would be the "year of national solidarity", he said, adding that the nation would witness the birth of peace and justice in the year.    Gen Sharif, however, stressed the need for the entire nation to extend support to the armed forces in this regard.    "Peace and justice will be ensured across the country with the support of the nation," he was quoted as saying by the Dawn.    He said the "elements involved in the bad practice of financial misappropriation" should also be dealt with strictly.    There was a nexus between terrorism,   corruption  and crime, he said, adding that the elements involved in terrorism and financial corruption had developed close relations to help each other out.    All the "negative forces" in the nexus would be defeated, said the army chief during a visit to review the progress made in the projects undertaken by army engineers as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. He went on to add that Balochistan would be turned into a peaceful province.    The army would help make the Gwadar seaport fully functional, he said, adding that the port would bring progress and prosperity to the people of Balochistan.    The army chief directed the officials concerned to take stringent measures for the security of engineers and labourers, particularly the Chinese nationals, working on various projects.    While highlighting the importance of the under- construction projects, Gen Sharif said all possible measures would be taken in collaboration with the provincial government to make Gwadar a safe city for local and foreign investors.    Underlining the potential of Balochistan as a hub for trade in the region, he said that completion of the projects was directly linked to the law and order situation and vowed that the armed forces would take all necessary actions to help bring back normalcy in the province.  terrorism,Raheel Sharif,Pakistan,CorruptionGeneral Sharif said the elements involved in terrorism and financial corruption had developed close relations to help each other out.
Engage or disengage, you can’t ignore other stakeholders: What Pathankot attack tells India, PakNew Delhi:  The terror attack on the air base at Pathankot on Saturday has again delivered the message loud and clear to the civilian political leadership of India and Pakistan: engage howsoever deep you may, you cannot leave out other players from the frame. Security forces personnel during their operation against the militants in Pathankot. PTI It has been an old strategy of forces either backed by or close to the Pakistani military establishment to unleash attacks in India ahead or after bilateral talks or peace initiatives. Coming a few days after Prime Minister  Narendra Modi ’s surprise visit to Pakistan, the latest attack only follows the familiar script. Counter-terrorism analyst Anil Kamboj said, “Pakistan military and its intelligence agency ISI that openly backs the terrorist groups to unleash attacks on Indian soil want to tell Nawaz Sharif that they are the final authority and not the PM. The Pak army doesn’t want any civilian peace talk or initiative to take place. They want an aggressive posture towards India and disrupt talks. On the next day of PM Modi’s visit to Pakistan, Jama'at-ud-Da'wah chief Hafiz Saeed spewed venom against India.” Recap of a few peace initiatives and attacks: ·  February 1999:  Former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee visited Pakistan and signed Lahore Treaty. Result: Kargil war in May-July 1999. ·  May 2014:   Narendra Modi  sworn-in as prime minister, which was attended by Nawaz Sharif. Result: Firing at India-Pakistan border in October 2014 that killed more than 30 people and a huge loss of property. ·  July 2015:  A day ahead of Modi-Sharif talks in Russia, a BSF jawan got killed in North Kashmir due to Pak firing. ·  September 2015:  BSF and Pakistan Rangers talk. Ahead of it, Gurdaspur terror attack occurred in July and a BSF bus was attacked at Udhampur in August that killed two personnel. ·  25 December, 2015:  Modi met Sharif in Pakistan. The Pathankot attack follows. Defence Analyst Maj Gen (retd) Dhruv Katoch remarked: “What’ll be Pakistan army’s existence if there is a long enduring peace between Indian and Pakistan? So they will never let any peace process fructify and the terror attacks to thwart dialogues are a proof of it. They also want to create an awkward position for the Indian government.” The Pathankot terror incidence has raised a few questions on the area of operation of the militants, target and objective of attack, modus operandi and the future. Here are five points to think about: 1. Why Punjab again? There has been a shift in terror activities from Jammu & Kashmir to Punjab, which has become a new target area. “The Valley is reasonably under control. Faced with pressure from the security agencies there, the militants are moving towards Punjab. It’s also easy for the militants from across the border to get into Punjab through J&K due to adjoining state borders. Another possible reason of targeting Punjab is to revive militancy in the state, the signs of which have already been found,” said Kamboj. 2. How did they infiltrate? According to security experts, the militants could have sneaked into the Indian soil through the  nullahs  at India-Pakistan border which don’t have wired fencing. Despite having electronic surveillance, infiltration could have taken place from any particular porous point along the long border. Intelligence sources said the militants entered on 30 December but the real picture would emerge only after further investigation. 3. The Pakistan hand Phone call intercepts of one of the militants have established a Pakistani connection. “It’s beyond doubt that without the support of the guards at the posts and  naakaas  on Pakistan side, the militants couldn’t have crossed over. And that is possible only when there’s an order from the top to a flanking post to allow them to cross. I refuse to believe that Pakistan Army and Rangers were not on board in this attack,” said Katoch. 4. Modus operandi Pathankot attack has a striking similarity with Gurdaspur terror attack where terrorists resorted to indiscriminate firing using AK-47. It caught security forces unawares. “There could be a possible connection with the IAF spy nabbed recently or any one from the past. It’s not possible for outside terrorists to know the exactness of a location or target without prior input. The terrorists made entry through rear part of the IAF base, which was vulnerable,” said Kamboj, former senior fellow, Institute for Defence Studies & Analysis (IDSA). 5. Why attack an air-base? It’s like destroying a jeep vis-à-vis a MiG aircraft. The aim is to cause maximum damage or garner maximum attention. An air-base has more value in terms of assets due to the presence of IAF fighter aircraft and choppers. As per the intelligence sources, the other defence establishments and research centres, particularly Tier-II cities, are on terrorists’ radar. also see Pakistan media accuses India of being 'reluctant to cooperate' as JIT arrives in Pathankot Congress should learn from past and not level baseless charges: BJP says nothing wrong if Pak wants to probe Pathankot case India staged Pathankot attack drama to malign Islamabad, says Pakistan JIT: Report Though the five Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) militants were trained ones, the Indian security forces — after a day-long gunfight — neutralised them, with three casualties on the Indian side. All the five militants have been killed. Out of three soldiers who were martyred during the combing operations at the IAF base, one Subedar Fateh Singh was a Commonwealth Gold and Silver medallist in shooting. “The attack looks like the militants were in desperation — quite similar to Gurdaspur attack. Despite the fact that militants were heavily armed with automatic weapons, our Indian forces fought brilliantly and prevented a large-scale tragedy. The government needs to adopt a doctrinal approach that any terrorist coming to India should be treated as an act of war, because these non-state actors, whether JeM or LeT, receive tremendous support from ISI,” added Katoch, former director, Centre for Land Warfare Studies (CLAWS). What do the intelligence sources say? “As per reports, these militants came to take revenge of the hanging of Afzal Guru of 2001 Parliament attack. Intelligence Bureau had alerted on possible terror attacks across several cities including Delhi during December end and New Year. Alerts were issued again after the IAF spy was arrested. This operation can’t be possible without local support. It can be in the form of a mole or sleeper cells or may be any local module of terror outfit. Investigation and post-attack analysis will reveal the exact picture. There are strong possibilities that close to 26 January, terrorists may attempt similar attacks. The states have been alerted,” an IB source added. What does the Ministry of Defence says? Defence Minister Manohar Parikkar called for an emergency meeting of the three services chiefs besides National Security Advisor, Ajit Doval. According to the ministry, “The Intelligence inputs had been available of a likely attempt by terrorists to infiltrate into the military installation in Pathankot area. In response, preparatory actions had been taken by the Indian Air Force (IAF) to thwart any such attempt. Due to the effective preparation and coordinated efforts by all the security agencies a group of terrorists were detected by the aerial surveillance platforms as soon as they entered the Air Force Station at Pathankot. The infiltrators were immediately engaged and contained within a limited area, thus preventing them from entering the Technical zone where high value assets are parked,” a ministry release said.Air base, Asia, CriticalPoint, Defence minister, diplomacy, India, Manohar Parrikar, Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan Army, Pakistan PM, Pathankot terror attack, peace talks, PM Narendra Modi, Punjab, Terrorism, WorldThe terror attack on the air base at Pathankot on Saturday has again delivered the message loud and clear to India and Pakistan.

Pathankot terror attack may challenge to India-Pakistan ties: Pak mediaIslamabad:  Pakistani media outlets on Sunday said the brazen attack by militants at a key Indian Air Force base will pose a "challenge to attempts to resurrect" the dialogue process between the two neighbours despite the goodwill generated by recent high-level meetings between their leaders. Pakistani media said the Pathankot terror attack was going to harm Indo-Pak ties. PTI On its front page lead 'Gunmen mount brazen attack on Indian air force base', the  Express Tribune  said the attack was over but it posed a "challenge to attempts to resurrect a moribund dialogue process between the two neighbours". The News International  reported that the assault by gunmen came a week after Prime Minister  Narendra Modi  made an unscheduled visit to his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif in an effort to revive bilateral talks. "Previous attempts at dialogue between the nuclear-armed neighbours have been derailed by similar incidents but, as Pakistani authorities condemned the raid, experts suggested the latest negotiations would prove more durable," it opined. Dawn  said that immediate indications from India after the Pathankot incident suggested that the foreign secretaries' talks would go ahead despite the setback, but the incident would impact the atmospherics. "India expects to complete initial probe into the incident before the meeting and its position at the talks would depend a lot on what comes out of the investigation," the paper said. also see Congress should learn from past and not level baseless charges: BJP says nothing wrong if Pak wants to probe Pathankot case India staged Pathankot attack drama to malign Islamabad, says Pakistan JIT: Report Pakistan media accuses India of being 'reluctant to cooperate' as JIT arrives in Pathankot "The Foreign Office said it hoped to build on the goodwill generated by recent high-level contacts," it added. As print media mostly focused on the attack and its likely impact on the peace process, the electronic media was busy in a matching response to Indian TV channels trying to find Pakistan link to the attack. Urdu language newspapers also gave wide coverage to the incident, while mostly focusing on the details of the attack and response by the Indian security forces. They also criticised accusation against Pakistan without investigations. Influential Jang newspaper reported that Indian officials in a typical kneejerk reaction blamed Pakistan for the attack.

4 Pak militants, 3 IAF men killed in terror attackSanjeev PargalJAMMU, Jan 2: Security forces today effectively thwarted, what could have been a major catastrophe, by eliminating four dreaded terrorists of Pakistan based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) at the Indian Air Force (IAF) station at Takki Chowk in Pathankot district, just 20 kilometers from Lakhanpur, the gateway to Jammu and Kashmir in early hours of this morning. Three security personnel including a ‘Garud commando’ of the IAF, attained martyrdom in the gunbattle.“All four militants killed by the security personnel in the gunbattle that raged for about 17 hours, starting 3.30 am, were Pakistanis affiliated with `Sneak and Strike’ team of Afzal Guru Squad of Jaish-e-Mohammad outfit, who had infiltrated into the Indian territory along river Beas from village Baniyal in Pathankot, the border between Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir, about three days back,” official sources told the Excelsior.IAF including its ‘Garud commandos’, NSG, Special Forces (also known as para commandos) of Army and Punjab Police SWAT teams jointly executed the entire operation that was declared closed at 7 pm with the killing of all four militants, sources said, adding a major catastrophe was averted as the security personnel didn’t allow the militants to reach close to IAF airbase as they were equipped with highly sophisticated arms and explosives capable of causing extensive damage inside.“Though the militants managed to enter the IAF station, located at Takki Chowk, about three kilometers from Pathankot, they were not allowed to reach to the airbase, thus, averting a major tragedy and foiling plan of the militants, for which they had been sent from Pakistan,” sources said.Sources said the men entered at about 3:30 am into the base, one of the largest of the IAF spread over about 2000 acres, through a gap in the peremitre wall which is heavily forested.“Because of the prior intelligence input, a Quick Reaction Team (QRT) was stationed there which made the first contact with the terrorist within 45 metres into the base,” the sources said.They added that while one terrorist was killed on the spot, the rest three scattered. The second terrorist was killed around 10 AM while the third and fourth terrorist were killed early evening.Director General of Police (DGP) K Rajendra told the Excelsior that there were no signs to indicate that the militants had infiltrated from the International Border (IB) in Jammu.“There were no signs of that (the militants’ intrusion from IB in Jammu sector),” Rajendra, who camped at Kathua along with IGP Jammu Danesh Rana, supervising operations to ensure that the militants didn’t enter into the State, said. The DGP toured various border areas on Kathua and Hiranagar sectors.Sources said the Pakistani terrorists were believed to have infiltrated into India during the intervening night of December 30-31 from a spot near Bamiyal village in Pathankot, located close to the International Border.The terrorists, official sources said, crossed over near Shakargarh in Pakistan to Bamiyal village and later changed into Army fatigues before kidnapping Salwinder Singh, a Superintendent of Police-rank officer, who was shunted out from Gurdaspur to take charge as Assistant Commandant of 75th battalion of Punjab Armed Police, at Kolian village.There were three occupants in the vehicle when it was hijacked by five militants which included Singh’s jeweller friend Rajesh Verma and the driver.While the terrorists slit the throat of other two, the police officer, who is facing charges of alleged breach of discipline, was released later and the vehicle was abandoned at Tajpur village, a place which is 2 km from the IAF’s Pathankot air base.One of the militants is alleged to have used the phone of the jeweller, who is undergoing treatment in a hospital, to make a call to Bhawalpur in Pakistan which was intercepted by intelligence agencies.The area from where the terrorists crossed over has a thick foliage of elephant grass which provides an automatic cover for them, they said.A tributary of river Beas enters into Pakistan from this village and this route is quite famous for drug smugglers to enter India.They had camped in the border areas before coming out on the highway and kidnapping three police officials of Punjab including a SP, killing one and releasing two others including the SP.Sources said it had become imminent yesterday that a group of militants had entered along Jammu-Punjab border and could strike anytime. All installations of security forces and police had been put on high alert in Jammu especially those located along Jammu-Pathankot National Highway to thwart the militant attack.According to sources, the Intelligence agencies had tracked atleast four calls the militants made from their mobile telephones to their handlers in Pakistan in which they continued to brief the handlers on their entry into India and, in turn, received directions from across the border on the attack. One of the militants had even spoken to his family before carrying out the attack. The militants had used Pakistani mobile telephones and spoke close to the IB, where Pakistani SIMs are workable.All these telephones have been seized to extract the data and other details.The militants had brought with them huge weaponry including AK-47, AK-56 and Insas rifles apart from sophisticated grenades and explosive material to cause huge devastation inside the IAF base but security personnel thwarted plans of the militants and their Pakistan based mentors.The weaponry seized from the militants had the marking of Jaish-e-Mohammad. According to sources, the militants were part of Jaish-e-Mohammad Afzal Guru Squad, which had been formed in Pakistan for sneak and strike attack, the one of which was witnessed in Tanghdar area of Kupwara sector in Kashmir valley sometime back.Sources said identity of slain militants couldn’t be established as they were not carrying any documents with them but they were confirmed Pakistanis by their language etc.It was after a long time that the Jaish-e-Mohammad outfit has come into limelight as previous fidayeen attacks on the Highways in Jammu and Punjab were executed by the Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) outfit. Sources said both LeT and JeM were frustrated following growing friendship between India and Pakistan especially after sudden visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Lahore on way back from Afghanistan to New Delhi and were in search of executing major terror attack to derail talks between the two countries.Sources said barring three initial casualties of IAF including that of `Garud commando’, the NSG, IAF, Special Forces and Punjab Police SWAT teams didn’t suffer any fresh casualties during the day long operation in which the IAF choppers were used to track down the battle hardened militants.Immediately after the attack, authorities suspended vehicular movement on Jammu-Pathankot National Highway. However, the train traffic was allowed with tightened security as rail track was far away from site of the gunbattle. Traffic on Jammu-Pathankot Highway was restored in the morning.However, traffic on Narot Jaimal Singh-Dinanagar road remained suspended for heavy vehicles throughout the day. Only small vehicles were being allowed on this road.Northern Command spokesperson Col SD Goswami said: intelligence inputs had been available of a likely attempt by terrorists to infiltrate into the military installations in Pathankot area. In response, preparatory actions had been taken by the IAF to thwart any such attempt”.Col Goswami said it was due to effective preparation and coordinated efforts by all security agencies that the terrorists were detected by aerial surveillance platforms as soon as they entered the Air Force station at Pathankot. He added that the infiltrators were immediately engaged and contained within a limited period, thus, preventing them from entering the Technical Zone, where “high value assets” are parked.“Through timely and prompt action by all agencies, the likely plan of the terrorists to destroy valuable assets of the Air Force has been foiled,” Col Goswami said.The IAF also said that timely intelligence and prompt action has foiled the likely plan of terrorists to destroy its valuable assets at the Pathankot air base.The Pathankot IAF facility, located about 40 kilometers away from the border with Pakistan, is the base of MiG-21 fighter planes and Mi-25 attack helicopters of Air Force.In a statement issued nearly 15 hours after a group of heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists stormed the air base, leading to a fierce gun battle in which three security personnel were killed along with five attackers, the Air Force said they had intelligence that such an attack would take place.Sources said with the obvious intention of destroying fighter jets and attack helicopters housed there, the group of terrorists in Army fatigues attempted to storm the base which is barely 40 kms from the International Border with Pakistan but failed to go beyond the outer periphery.In heavy exchange of fire, a commando and two other personnel of the IAF were killed along with all the five attackers. At least, six security men were also injured.The terrorists, who are said to have infiltrated three days ago, launched the first ever attack on an Indian Air base at around 3.30 am, their obvious targets being MiG-21 fighter aircraft and MI-25 attack helicopters.The terrorists could not go beyond the ‘langar’ (eating place) near the outer perimeter of the IAF complex as the security forces were ready to take them on, officials said about the operation which was supervised directly by Doval.However, after a brief lull, sounds of gunshots and blasts were again heard as the security forces started a combing operation.The security establishment had anticipated a terror attack after some armed men abducted an SP of Punjab Police on Thursday night and as a result a team of NSG commandos had been rushed here last night itself after the NSA held a series of meetings with the Army chief and top IB officials yesterday. Two columns of Army (comprising about 50 men) were also positioned at the Air base, officials said.IAF used its two attack helicopters to assist the joint team of ground troops to neutralise the terrorists, the sources said.The terrorists, with huge quantity of RDX in their possession, made their way to the base from the back side where there is a jungle, they said.This was the second big terror attack in Punjab in less than a year. Three terrorists had stormed a police station in Dina Nagar in Gurdaspur in July last year before being eliminated in a 12-hour gunbattle.A team of National Investigation Agency (NIA), mandated to probe terror cases, today reached Pathankot IAF base to gather inputs about the attack.

Pathankot attack: Fresh gunshots, blasts heard from inside air base, 3 injuredNEW DELHI: Fresh gunshots were heard while an Improvised Explosive Device exploded on Sunday during the combing operation at the Indian Air Force frontier base in Punjab's Pathankot, which was attacked by Pakistani terrorists on Saturday.    Three security personnel belonging to the National Security Guard were injured in the blast, news agency PTI said. The combing operation that began late on Saturday evening is still on.    There is speculation that a sixth terrorist could still be holed up inside the air base. The attackers, five of whom were killed on Saturday, are believed to belong to Jaish-e-Mohammad headed by Maulana Masood Azhar of the Kandahar hijack episode.    The attack came a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an unscheduled visit to Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif in an effort to revive talks between the two countries.    Officials said the attack on the military base, just 25 km from the border with Pakistan, bore the hallmarks of previous assaults by Pakistan-based militant groups, underscoring the fragility of recent efforts to revive bilateral talks between the uneasy neighbours.  Meanwhile, in the seventh casualty among the security forces, Lt Col Niranjan Kumar of the National Security Guard died in hospital on Sunday morning. He was injured in an IED blast while retrieving the body of a terrorist.    An eight-member team of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has reached Pathankot in Punjab to take over the probe into the attack.

Agencies intercepted 4 calls, including one to a terrorist’s motherNEW DELHI: The Jaish-e-Mohammad fidayeen were in touch not only with their Pakistan-based handlers ahead of Pathankot attack but one of them even took out time to contact his mother. "I am on a suicide mission," he repeated twice to his mother before telling her that "Allah will take care of all of us".    Strangely, his mother ended the 70-second call, made around 1.58 am, by asking her fidayeen son to eat. "Son, please have some food before you lay down your life," she said.     READ ALSO   Pathankot strike plotted by Pak army HQ?    The other three calls were purely business. All conversations, intercepted by the Indian intelligence agencies, were in Punjabi laced with a distinct Multani dialect. The first call, made at 12.30 am, lasted 55 seconds. There were three persons on the other side and all of them talked to the fidayeen caller one by one.    The second call was made at around 12.52 am and lasted around 32 seconds. One person can be heard in the conversation passing instructions, though there are no clear details. Two terrorists are believed to taken turns to speak to the caller.    The third call, the longest at 87 seconds, was made at 1.10 am. ""Control me hai (is everything in control)?" asked a man on the other side. "Haan (yes)," one of the terrorists replied. The handler can then be heard asking the terrorists to "enter target".    "Helicopters aur planes ko uda do (Blow up the helicopters and planes)," he instructs the terrorists.     READ ALSO   Terrorist attacks in Punjab since 2001    "Use samjhao, hame fikr hai," he adds. The agencies are still trying to decipher and understand the context of this statement.    The fourth call was made by a fidayeen to his mother.    The intercepted calls will serve as conclusive evidence that the Pathankot attack was launched from Pakistan.    Incidentally, there is yet another call to prove the complicity of Pakistan-based handlers. This call was made by the handlers to arrange a taxi for the fidayeen.    Sources said the driver of the Toyota Innova taxi used by the terrorists on Friday was called from a Pakistan number. The Pakistani caller asked the driver to pick up the fidayeen from a particular spot in Pathankot.     READ ALSO:As it happened:  Pathankot terror attack    Security agencies are questioning the driver and trying to find out whether the driver had been offering regular services to Pakistan-based smugglers, who may have links with the terrorists, or if it was a plain case of his not realising that he was being called from a Pakistan number.    The sources said that the car was used for travelling on an untarred road and dumped after the rim of the vehicle got damaged.    The terrorist then hijacked an SUV (Mahindra SUV X500) in which a Superintendent of Punjab Police was travelling along with a friend and a cook.    The SP and the cook were forced to leave the vehicle while the friend, a jeweller, was taken as hostage.    The terrorists snatched a mobile phone from them and used it to dial the number in Pakistan which was used to call the driver of the Toyota Innova.    Since the Pakistani number was under surveillance, security agencies were able to pinpoint the possible target of terrorists, leading to dispatching of 160 NSG commandos, army special forces and others as reinforcements.     Times View    To call off the proposed talks with Pakistan because of this attack would be a mistake. It is no secret that there is a string section within the Pakistani 'deep state' that is hostile to the idea of peace with India. If India responds to every terrorist attack on its soil launched from within Pakistan by putting the process of talks on hold, it would play into the hands of these elements. It makes more sense to strengthen the hands of pro-peace elements in Pakistan, including the civilian government, by staying engaged. On its part, the Pakistani government must show real intent in curbing the use of its territory for attacks on India.  Blow up planes, choppers, handler told terrorists
Indo-Pak peace: Pathankot terror strike a grim reminder of the turbulent path aheadBy Sreeram Chaulia    Prime minister Narendra Modi's surprise landing in Lahore has set up a New Year with the potential to chart a virtuous path in South Asia. Yet, the brooding shadow of terrorism and the backlog of mistrust mean that Modi's spectacular photo-op with   Pakistan  prime minister Nawaz Sharif on his birthday is just the beginning of a turbulent and unpredictable process.    For India, how far the constructive turn goes depends singularly on whether Pakistan will kick its terrorist addiction. Despite the disturbing attack on the   Pathankot  airbase by Pakistan-based jihadists, violations along the Line of Control (LoC) and infiltration of jihadists have dipped in the last couple of months. The security situation in Jammu &   Kashmir  is relatively stable. While there are small firefights and ambushes, the Indian Army has stated that the "potential of militants has significantly reduced and terrorism indicators have shown a declining trend".    Modi is keen to cash in on this weakening of terrorist activity by pushing Pakistan to terminate arming and financing jihadists. He is seizing on a slender propitious pattern, while hedging his bets by insisting that   India  will "judge progress on their commitments on terrorism".    Since Sharif is not in control of Pakistan's national security apparatus, the billion-dollar question on everyone's lips is whether or not the terror tap will be turned on top gear by the Pakistani Army and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) as the bilateral dialogue hurts their vested interests. Previous Indian PMs have been deceived by bonhomie from civilian counterparts in Pakistan who could not carry along their hard-line military and allied Islamists.     Realistic Liberalism    To skeptics, Modi is destined to end up chastened by the visceral anti-India attitude which defines Pakistani nationalism and Islamist outlook. But by securing India's homeland better against terrorist attacks and ushering in normalcy in Jammu & Kashmir, he can be in a stronger position to do business with liberal-minded elements of the Pakistani polity.    The ISI and its spoilers cannot wreck the peace process at their whim and fancy if, despite characteristic malevolent intentions, their capacity to harm India is blunted due to reordered priorities of facing domestic counter-insurgencies in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as well as through India's own proactive internal and crossborder security measures. Modi's thaw with Pakistan needs to rest on this realistic liberalism.    While critics dismiss the friendly Modi-Sharif body language and oneon-one connections between leaders as attention-seeking showmanship, the Modi government has highlighted "personal chemistry as a powerful tool in our diplomatic kit".    This owes to Modi's persona and his conviction that systems prone to failure can be made to change through determined human effort rather than abandoning them. He realises he must try to reverse the negative tide with Pakistan while retaining healthy skepticism about its military establishment.    Sharif has acknowledged that "goodwill gestures are the solution to many an ill". While Modi's 'buddy up' style of foreign policy may not be a solution in itself, it does create a constituency in Pakistan that is on his wavelength and can be useful to ease hurdles that are bound to arise as the two countries attempt nitty-gritty talks.    Sharif's foreign policy adviser Sartaj Aziz has remarked that of the roster of subjects to be finalised for dialogue between the foreign secretaries of the two countries, "there would be progress on some issues soon while it will take time for progress on others". Such a disaggregated stance is preferable to an all-or-nothing one. We can pick the proverbial low-hanging fruits first— easing cross-border trade, tourism and visas, settling the Sir Creek and Wullar Barrage disputes, and implementing gas, petroleum and electricity sector cooperation.    Protracted and bitter bilateral conflicts rarely yield instant peace and the best one can hope for is that, in 2016, India and Pakistan will move forward on some issues where there is a win-win logic and keep channels of communication going on harder topics where their presently defined national interests clash.    Like Modi, Sharif is a pragmatic politician who aims to tackle Pakistan's economic woes, power shortages and infrastructural lacunae. He knows that the Pakistan's military establishment's bottom line of forcing Kashmir's secession from India has not been realised after nearly 70 years of warfare and sponsorship of jihad. Ergo, he wants to take what is practically possible from India, say increased access to our vast consumer market for Pakistani products, and get re-elected in 2018.                       (Narendra Modi and Nawaz Sharif in Lahore on December 25, 2015)      Meanwhile, as the bloody jihadist strike in Pathankot reminded, Modi has no reason to be complacent that the Pakistani military will restrain itself. His peace policy can only work once our security agencies prevail and completely eliminate the threat of jihadists massing across the border.    If the parallel rationales of Sharif and Modi succeed, it could usher in a new dawn for the people of the subcontinent. Will history repeat itself or be rewritten?       (The writer is a professor and dean at the Jindal School of International Affairs)   Sunday ET,Pathankot,Pakistan,Narendra Modi,kashmir,IndiaThe attack, a week after Modi's Pak visit and a fortnight before the two countries foreign secys meet, is a grim reminder of the turbulent path ahead.
Pathankot attack: Cops on toes in capitalNEW DELHI: Security in the capital was beefed up after an alert was sounded by intelligence agencies following the attack at the Pathankot Air Base. Checks were increased at the airports, railway stations, bus stands and other vital installations around the city, especially for vehicles coming from Punjab and Haryana.    Later in the day, Union tourism minister, Mahesh Sharma, took stock of the situation at Qutub Minar and India Gate and other heritages sites that are frequented by foreign tourists. Vigil was also heightened in several areas, including popular markets in south and central Delhi, as well as in Lutyens' Delhi. The Delhi Police SWAT teams were also put on alert to prevent a Pathankot-like attack.    Additional personnel from the paramilitary forces were deployed around Delhi Cantonment and Mehrauli to keep a watch on the movement of people in these areas. Security at defence installations was also beefed up.    Special police commissioner (law and order), Deepak Mishra, along with officials of crime branch and special cell took stock of the situation.    Other security units have also been roped in to form a strategy in connection with potential threats to VIPs in the capital. Police teams have also been deployed.    Local police have been asked to remain extra vigilant about suspicious movements in their localities. Police officers said shopkeepers selling clothes, including trousers with army fatigues, have also been asked to inform about anyone buying such items in bulk.    Quick response teams have also been deployed in several parts of the city in case of an emergency situation, a senior police official added. Central security agencies have alerted all states and Union Territories to step up vigilance.    Intelligence agencies have issued a nationwide advisory asking all states to deploy additional forces in crowded places to foil any possible attempt by terror outfits to carry out attacks. The advisory was issued after intelligence inputs suggested that Pakistan-based terror groups may try to create trouble, official sources said. There is also a threat of lone-wolf attacks by Islamic State-inspired, radicalised elements.    Police forces of major cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Goa have been asked to be extra vigilant post the New Year celebrations.   Security in the capital was beefed up after an alert was sounded by intelligence agencies following the attack at the Pathankot Air Base
No link so far between arrested IAF official and Pathankot blast: PoliceNEW DELHI:   Delhi Police  sleuths interrogating a dismissed   IAF  official, who was arrested from Punjab's   Bhatinda , have so far not found any connection between the information he allegedly shared with a suspected ISI-backed operative and the terror attack in Pathankot today.   A Delhi court today remanded the dismissed IAF official,   Ranjith KK , arrested earlier this week for allegedly sharing secret information with Pakistan's ISI, to two more days of police custody to enable the agency to interrogate him in connection with the   Pathankot terror attack .   "We interrogated the dismissed official for several hours today but so far we haven't found any connection between the information he has shared with a cyber entity, who honeytrapped him over a social neyworking site, claiming to be a woman media personnel from UK and the attack at the Air Force base in Pathankot," said a police official.   "Investigation into the matter is underway and our concerns were legitimate," the official said.   He said that the investigating officer of the case had sought an extension of the remand to ascertain whether any of Ranjith's disclosures had any connection with the Pathankot attack, not that he had made any such disclosures in the first four days of interrogation.   Ranjith KK, a leading aircraft man with Indian Air Force posted at Bhatinda, was dismissed recently and later arrested after a combined operation by Delhi Police's Crime Branch, Military Intelligence and Air Force Liaisoning Unit (LU). He has been booked under Official Secrets Act, police said.   Ranjith was honeytrapped by a cyber entity by the name Damini McNaught, who pretended to be the executive of a UK-based media firm, and claimed that she required Air Force-related information for an article in their news magazine from Ranjith in exchange for pecuniary benefits.   Ranjith allegedly shared Air Force-related information, mostly pertaining to a recent exercise, movements of aircraft and deployment of various units, in exchange for money transferred to his bank account, police said.

Pathankot attack: Multi-layer security put in place in key defence establishments of regionChandigarh: Security has been beefed up in military cantonments and defence establishments of the region following the fidayeen attack at Air Force station, Pathankot. Considering the "vulnerable security scenario" in the border areas of the region, Amy authorities have ordered its troops, located in various cantonments, to upgrade the security at highest level.   Directions have also been issued to form more quick reaction teams (QRTs) in the cantonment areas to meet any eventuality. Multi-tier search and extra barricades have been placed at the gates of cantonments to ensure no unwanted element could enter the military area.     READ ALSO   Pathankot strike plotted by Pak army HQ?    Extra layer of security personnel along with snipers has also been deployed to secure the cantonment areas. Even the military personnel entering the cantonment areas are also checked thoroughly by the military police.   The region has a many key defence establishments, which are important not only during war but also for surveillance on borders during peacetime. The region is also the headquarters of premier Western Command that secures country's western front. Security has been beefed up in military cantonments and defence establishments of the region following the fidayeen attack at Air Force station, Pathankot.
Agencies decoded Pathankot attack plan on Friday morning: SourcesNew Delhi:  The government got wind of the plan by Pak-based terrorists to attack a defence establishment in Pathankot on Friday morning itself after which National Security Advisor Ajit Doval held a meeting  with officials of defence and home ministries besides Intelligence Bureau, RAW and other agencies.   In fact, an advanced team of about 50 Black Cat commandos was rushed to Pathankot in a special aircraft on Friday evening itself, while about 110 more rushed by late night, hours before five heavily armed terrorists attacked the Pathankot air-base.     READ ALSO   Agencies intercepted 4 calls by terrorists    Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief (Western Air Command) Air Marshal S B Deo was sent to the location to personally supervise and coordinate with the Army, NSG and local police for exchange of information and operational details. Sources said shops in the area were closed down to avoid collateral damage.   Sources in Delhi said the agencies connected the dots of the attack on Friday itself after it was learnt that Gurdaspur SP Salwinder Singh was abducted along with his jeweller friend Rajesh Verma and cook Mohan Lal in the early hours.   Sources said the five attackers may have entered India on the intervening night of Thursday and Friday (New Year's eve) from a spot near Bamiyal village in Pathankot, located close to the international border.     READ ALSO   Timely intel averts major political setback for govt    A senior counter terror official said, "It is too early to conclude but it appears that the terrorists crossed over from Shakargarh in Pakistan to Bamiyal village and later changed into army uniform before kidnapping Salwinder Singh." This route is often used by drugs smugglers as well, said sources.   Salwinder Singh was released after one hour, but Punjab police and intelligence agencies smelt a possible major terror plan considering the abductors were carrying assault rifles and equipped heavily to carry out a big attack like like 26/11.   Sources said by dawn, IB and RAW had managed to decode the plan through interception and inputs.     READ ALSO   Pathankot strike plotted by Pak army HQ?    The terrorists could not go beyond the 'langar' (eating place) near the outer perimeter of the IAF complex as the security forces were ready to take them on, officials said about the operation which was supervised directly by Doval.   The National Security Adviser is learnt to have immediately asked the forces to step up security at all defence establishments in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir while intelligence agencies were asked to trace the location of terrorists.   While terrorists are learnt to have entered the air force base in Pathankot around 3am on Saturday, the commandoes of Indian Air Force and NSG were placed at strategic locations to secure the MiG-21 fighter planes and MI-25 attack helicopters. Commandos were reportedly deployed at several other defence establishments.     READ ALSO   Pak condemns attack on airbase    A team of National Investigation Agency reached Pathankot on Saturday morning to gather inputs on the attack.   Soon after the attack, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar cut short his stay in Goa and returned to Delhi where he held a high-level meeting with the NSA and the three Service chiefs.   The home ministry is likely to hand over the probe to NIA after consultation with the state government. NIA had also probed the August 5 Udhampur attack on BSF convoy. NSG commandoes were rushed even before attack
Attack shadow likely over FS-level talks in IslamabadNew Delhi: As the Pathankot air base terror attack continued through Saturday, the political odds on Modi's peace initiative with Pakistan have lengthened and the next steps such as foreign secretary-level talks later this month face a few testing moments.   India's moves will be determined by the government's assessment about the level of involvement of Pakistan's military-intelligence establishment in the Pathankot attack. The choice of target and methodology of the operation don't lend themselves to the rogue attack explanation.   But, having launched a full-scale peace initiative with Nawaz Sharif, the Modi government wants to avoid a knee-jerk reaction, sources said. The MEA spokesperson too refused to commit himself when he tweeted that it was too early to say "anything more".   The immediate prospects seem uncertain. Indian and Pakistani foreign secretary talks are scheduled for 14-15 January in Islamabad. Even if they happen now, the sequence of subsequent steps, including moving to the political level, may be in question even if the government wants to maintain the momentum.   For the time being, the government, which promised "firm response" to terror attacks will be put to test, particularly since the attack was against a prized security asset. This would also be the second big attack from across the border, in the same area, which calls into question security preparedness on that part of the border.   The challenge will be to respond while maintaining lines of communication with Pakistan. The Doval-Janjua line could be the active channel right now. During their first conversation in Bangkok on December 6, NSA Ajit Doval told his new interlocutor, Nasir Janjua, that India would be looking for verifiable assurance from the Pakistan army-ISI complex that they were not "involved" in terrorism against India.   Islamabad's level of cooperation would depend on the Pakistan army's determination of how important the India relationship is. It will be next to impossible to convince Indians that Pakistan's notorious security establishment - or at least some elements in it - are not behind this, or in the know. That would lead to the question of India's assessment about how much the Pakistan army-ISI complex is really "on board" the present peace initiative.   Then, initial reports arrogated responsibility to Jaish-e-Mohammed (JEM) a terror group created by Masood Azhar after being released by India in December 1999. Initially functioning under the aegis of the Pakistan security establishment, JEM also became close to Al Qaeda and was responsible for a couple of attempts on the life of former president Pervez Musharraf. Over the years, though, as war against terror groups in Pakistan intensified, the distinctions between many of these groups broke down. Therefore, while some elements of JEM may be beyond the control of the Pakistan establishment, only Pakistan can provide evidence that the establishment is not involved.   But for the present, the assumption that terror attacks have official blessing will be prevalent. Its also a truism that terror attacks follow any attempt at India-Pakistan rapprochement. And therefore, Modi's Lahore impulsiveness will come under question. Already the government has refrained from making hay on the personal diplomacy bit, but its policy impact will only be felt in the coming days. As the Pathankot air base terror attack continued through Saturday, the political odds on Modi’s peace initiative with Pakistan have lengthened and the next steps such as foreign secretary-level talks later this month face a few testing moments.
Pak slams terror attack, says those opposed to Indo-Pak peace behind itIslamabad: Strongly condemning the Pathankot terror assault, Pakistan foreign office said in a statement on Saturday that it remains committed to partner India to completely eradicate the menace of terrorism afflicting "our region".   Foreign office spokesman Qazi Khalilullah said, "Pakistan extends heartfelt condolences to the Government and people of India and the bereaved families and wish the wounded speedy and full recovery. Our deep sympathies are with families of killed and injured.   "Pakistan itself has been a target of terrorism. Hence, we can understand the Indian pain," Khalilullah said, and added that the recent goodwill gestures between the two countries have led to friendly ties.   Veteran journalist Rahimullah Yousafzai, warning that those against peace between India and Pakistan could make more attempts to terrorize the people, said, "Modi's meeting Sharif was a bold, timely and courageous political step. We need more such gestures from both sides.   "(But) strong and influential spoilers on both sides of the border will not easily give up attempts to strain bilateral relations.... The key to success in Indo-Pak ties lies with media. It needs to play its role responsibly as it can make or break anything."   Terming Modi's recent Lahore visit as a big gesture, Ashraf Jahangir Qazi, ex-Pakistani high commissioner to India, said sincere leadership on both sides is required to carry forward the challenging relationship. He said complications in India-Pakistan relations offer so much for anti-peace constituencies in both countries that they can draw any conclusion from mishaps as occurred in Pathankot.   "It can be a reaction to Modi-Nawaz meeting. It can be linked to an ongoing struggle in Kashmir but you cannot stop anyone from blame-game. There should be some basis to have an opinion as drawing conclusions on the basis of speculations serve no one's interest," Qazi said. "If we overcome such irritants, it will help in trimming down the trust deficit between the two countries," he added.   Amir Mateen, another Pakistani analyst, takes Saturday's attack as a test case for authorities from both sides.   "The Pathankot attack is a test of India-Pakistan detente. How officials from both sides take it up will determine their resolve in tackling the menace of terrorism," he said. Mateen claimed that though hawks in Pakistan have been put on the defensive but still they have a considerable following. "It is a serious test for PM Sharif and his company how to keep the hawkish elements in check," he added. Strongly condemning the Pathankot terror assault, Pakistan foreign office said in a statement on Saturday that it remains committed to partner India to completely eradicate the menace of terrorism afflicting “our region”.
Punjab strike subjects Modi’s Pak policy to political pressure testNew Delhi: When Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the threat to the peace process from forces opposed to reconciliation he perhaps knew exactly what he was talking about and Modi too did not need to travel to Lahore to figure the risks.   As the Pathankot attack reveals, Modi faces a political stress test: preserving the opportunity his innovative diplomacy created against a blow-back from not only the opposition and saffron hardliners but also a public opinion that equates the neighbour with terrorism.     READ ALSO   Attack shadow likely over FS-level talks in Islamabad    This time, the government was spared a major embarrassment as the jihadis who attacked the IAF base were checked before they could inflict any damage on high value military assets at the base. While two personnel died, destruction of aircraft at the sensitive forward base would have been a calamity.        Though Modi instinctively grasps the need to remain engaged with Pakistan, the next, possibly graver, attack will lessen his elbow room. But his calculation could be that India cannot be faulted for not trying and, despite the Pakistan army's veto on Indian policy, gaining a "peace buddy" in Sharif has its benefits, even if only by way of optics.   The official Pakistan reaction to the Pathankot strike seems to confirm this expectation as it notes that "Building on the goodwill created during the recent high level contacts between the two countries, Pakistan remains committed to partner with India as well as other countries in the region to completely eradicate the menace of terrorism afflicting our region".     READ ALSO   Satan could change but not Pak, says Adityanath    The commitment will be tested if the relationship does not move beyond the current warm feelings and good intent. Sharif is not just dealing with a state-Jihadi nexus, but also radicalization fanned by fundamentalist madarsas and official narratives of Indian perfidy in Kashmir.   His bold move to "drop by" in Lahore was intended to break restraints imposed by official frameworks and build a personal chemistry with Sharif. The suddenness of the visit ambushed not just hawks on both sides but prevented a Pathankot-type incident derailing pre-scheduled talks as happened with the NSA-level meet last year.   There will, however, be pressure to seek clearer commitments from Pakistan on curtailing terror its military and intelligence agencies export to India, increasing the salience of terrorism - already a key part of the revamped "comprehensive dialogue" - in bilateral discussions.     READ ALSO   As it happened: Pathankot terror attack    Congress quickly reminded the PM that the strike on Pathankot comes seven days after the engagement in Lahore. Environment minister Prakash Javadekar underlined BJP's bottom lines when he said talks cannot go hand in hand with terror.   Since assuming office, Modi has sanctioned some useful measures against Pakistani aggression. The military response at the border and LoC to ceasefire violations is severe and diplomatically India has sealed important breakthroughs, reducing ISI's comfort zone in the Gulf. The problem remains that options to retaliate against terrorism that provokes - but remains well below the Mumbai 26/11 threshold -- as in Pathankot are limited. When Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the threat to the peace process from forces opposed to reconciliation he perhaps knew exactly what he was talking about and Modi too did not need to travel to Lahore to figure the risks.
Gurdaspur, Pathankot attackers infiltrated at the same point?Pathankot: The terrorists who attacked the Pathankot Indian Air Force base may have infiltrated into India at the same point as the perpetrators of the July 27 Gurdaspur terror attack. Police officers have again pointed to the BSF border outpost at Bamiyal in Pathankot as their possible point of entry.   Bamiyal is barely 40 km from Dinanagar with a population of around 700, mostly defence personnel. The National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) analysed the data in the GPS devices recovered from the three dead terrorists immediately after the Gurdaspur attack, and found 12 different pre-fed locations in the devices which confirmed Punjab Police's stand.     READ ALSO   Gurdaspur SP talked his way to freedom from ultras    However, BSF has consistently maintained that the Lashkar-e-Taiba militants who attacked Gurdaspur's Dinanagar police station had not breached Punjab's international border. Top officials told TOI that they didn't find anything untoward during their search operation on Friday.   Experts said the BSF should find out if there are tunnels between India and Pakistan along the border which may be big enough for men to use. That drug smugglers from Pakistan use smaller tunnels to slip contraband into India is already a well-established fact among security agencies.   "The best targets for terrorists to strike at are those which can be reached after one night's travel, may be on foot or by a small vehicle, and both Dinanagar and Pathankot fit into this category," former Punjab Frontier BSF inspector general M S Malhi told TOI.   He said the area along the Pakistan border in Punjab has rivers, tributaries, contributories and broken ground where rivers criss-cross at several places. This makes surveillance difficult. "Either the terrorists know some major weakness on the border or they have dug a tunnel," he says.     READ ALSO   Pak 'fidayeen' in Army dress kill 1 in Punjab, hijack senior cop's car    His strong suspicion is that there is a tunnel. "This is the reason they are striking at their will in this region despite there being so much security at the border," he added.   In the past, BSF had detected a couple of tunnels connecting India and Pakistan. Malhi added that terrorist organizations start digging tunnels in September after monsoon and use them for infiltration between December and February. "Inspectors general of frontiers of both Punjab and Jammu should constitute a joint team to patrol these hostile terrains."   Another retired BSF IG Himmat Singh said the many small and rivulets entering Punjab from the Jammu region make sneaking of terrorists easier. Besides, immediately after crossing the border, terrorists have access to roads to reach their target and strike.   "In this case also they didn't reach Pathankot air force base by chance but it was pre planned," he said. He didn't rule out the possibility of terrorists entering from Jammu and Kashmir border. "But then there is high alert and level of checking must be very high," he said. The terrorists who attacked the Pathankot Indian Air Force base may have infiltrated into India at the same point as the perpetrators of the July 27 Gurdaspur terror attack. Police officers have again pointed to the BSF border outpost at Bamiyal in Pathankot as their possible point of entry.
Cops need better arms to fight terror KOLKATA: The terror strike in Pat hankot has again brought to focus how vulnerable any urban area is to such an attack. Is Kolkata prepared to withstand such a fidayeen ambush?   While the city is far from a lame duck and has a response system in place, there are certain grey areas that need to be plugged, given the ci ty's on-and-off brush with subversi ves who have used it as a conduit or hideaway , say security experts.   In Pathankot, the Punjab Police's SWAT was the first responder. Kolka ta Police on Saturday said it has equal confidence in its specialized units -Combat Force and Special Action Force (SAF) -apart from the usual emergency responders. SAF , set up after the 2611Mumbai attacks, has 10 snipers and several commandos And a major reassurance is that a unit of the elite National Security Guards (NSG) is stationed at Barrackpore. The Army , too, has a formi dable presence in the city .   However, a section of the home department, police and central agen cies are worried about their lack of fi repower and training. "The speciali zed units are often deployed for VVIP security or even major law and order issues. There is not much real-life sti mulated training available," said a se nior officer of a central agency .   Kolkata Police's arsenal doesn't have enough to match the best in the country . "While we have snipers, the re is a dearth of modern sniper rifles, telescopic sights, night-vision devices and tracking gadgets. The police has been demanding Dragunov rifles (range of 1000 metres) since 2008, but the home ministry is yet to agree on the numbers," said a source.   Kolkata Police still carry the antiquated sten guns, notorious for accidental firing and jamming. In 2012, Kolkata Police had drawn up an ambitious plan to buy Heckler and Koch MP-5, a close-combat weapon that can fire 800 rounds a minute, to replace the stens and AK-47s. Twenty-five MP5s were to be bought but not one has arrived yet. Sources said the home ministry has not been able to "meet the demand" of various state police forces. The Pathankot attack led to a tightening of security in Kolkata, as well.Vigil was heightened at Metro stations, malls and market areas. Kolkata airport, for obvious reasons, got the maximum attention. "We have put up two naka checks -one close to the entry flyover and another near gate number 5. While CISF has begun anti-terror drills inside the airport, we are putting special emphasis in keeping the cargo handling area approach safe too," said an officer of Bidhannagar commissionerate.   "The city police also plan to use drones to keep an eye on busy areas," said an IPS officer of Kolkata Police.They have sought a report from Metro Railways on the entry and exit gates of stations in the network. The terror strike in Pat hankot has again brought to focus how vulnerable any urban area is to such an attack. Is Kolkata prepared to withstand such a fidayeen ambush?
Cops: Terrorists may have got local supportPathankot: Punjab police are investigating if the fidayeen who attacked the Pathankot Air Force station had local contacts that provided them logistical support and details about the region's topography.   Sources said after crossing the international border, the terrorists first contacted taxi driver Ikaagar Singh who they questioned about the location of Pathankot air force base. When Ikaagar got suspicious, they slit his throat.   "It's yet to be confirmed if they used an Indian SIM card to call Ikaagar or if the call was made from a Pakistani SIM," an official said.   "They also snatched the mobile phone of the Punjab Police SP whom they carjacked and made a call to Pakistan," said sources. After dropping the SP they went ahead with his companions Sharma and Lal. The terrorists injured Lal and also dropped him before moving towards Pathankot air base along with Sharma.   "When they reached the rear of the IAF station, they parked the car at a place where some soil had already been dug," the official. The ditch had been dug to ensure that the car is not easily noticed from the road. Only its roof was visible from a distance. This has again raised suspicion that the attackers had help.   A senior police officer said they believe that terrorists already knew the place. "We are not sure of any local support, it has not been established yet but we don't rule out the possibility" he said. Punjab police are investigating if the fidayeen who attacked the Pathankot Air Force station had local contacts that provided them logistical support and details about the region’s topography.
JMB man's Jaish links under lens KOLKATA: In the wake of the Pathankot attack, National Investigation Agency, which is probing the Khagragarh blasts, is likely to question Jamiaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) leader Zia Ul Haque over his suspected involvement with Jaish-e-Mohammed, the terror outfit believed o be behind the fidayeen strike in Pathankot. Haque is one of the big guns among the 28 accused in he Khagragarh blasts. He ma ntained his contacts with Ja sh-e-Mohammed while he was actively running campaigns for Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh, say sources.   Haque's job was to propagate the philosophy of jihad among the youth. Arrested by NIA in 2014, Haque was one of the JMB trainers who allegedly kept close contact with Jaish-e-Mohammed. The JMB leader was also a strong supporter of jihad against India and Kashmir.   After Haque's arrest, NIA officials were surprised to find several video clips and spee ches of different Jaish-e-Mohammed leaders in his laptop.   That apart, the central agency also recovered a pen drive from Haque, which contained speeches of Jaish-e-Mohammed leader Maulana Masood Azhar.   In those speeches, the Jaish-e-Mohammed leader was exhorting for violent jihad against India and Kashmir.The pen drive that was recovered also had his speeches on suicide bombing.   According to NIA sources, they are trying to unearth his contacts with Jaish-e-Mohammed and his involvement with the fidayeen group.   While being in custody, Haque initially tried to suppress his links with Jaish-e-Mohammed. But he could not cover it for long after the investigators recovered the pen drive from his brother, who is from Malda.   They not only had speeches of Maulana Masood Azahar but also contained lectures by members of another Pakistan-based terrorist outfit.   Sources in NIA said that Jaish-e-Mohammed's links in Bengal were active for long. In 2007, the arrest of two HUJI militants -Tariq Qasmi and Khalid Mujahid -brought this to fore. During investigation it was found that Qasmi's aide, Mukhtar alias Raju, used Malda as a hideout.   Police had earlier arrested Jaish-e-Mohammed acti vists from Hingalgunj area.   The sleuths also found that members of the banned terrorist outfit were using parts of West Bengal as safe corridors for crossing over to Bangladesh.   One of the Jaish-e-Mohammed activists, Belal Hossain alias Nanu Mondal, arrested for his alleged links with the Kandahar hijack also had cases against him in several police stations of West Bengal.   NIA investigators have reasons to believe that Haque was trying to exploit his existing network of Jaish-eMohammed in West Bengal.   They suspect that during his trips to Bangladesh, Haque had contacted several Jaish-e-Mohammed leaders who were trying to make a base in the country.   Investigators also found that Haque had several speeches on Assam riot and Gujarat riot that he had used during his motivation camps.   Finding the sources from where he procured the details of the Jaish-e-Mohammed fidayeen videos, stored in the pen drive, would open up new avenues for the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the investigation. In the wake of the Pathankot attack, National Investigation Agency, which is probing the Khagragarh blasts, is likely to question Jamiaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) leader Zia Ul Haque over his suspected involvement with Jaish-e-Mohammed, the terror outfit believed o be behind the fidayeen strike in Pathankot. Haque is one of the big guns among the 28 accused in he Khagragarh blasts. He ma ntained his contacts with Ja sh-e-Mohammed while he was actively running campaigns for Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh, say sources.
One attack can’t stall talks: BJPNew Delhi:  In the wake of Saturday's attack on Pathankot airbase by Pak-based terrorists, BJP said the resumed dialogue cannot be revoked due to "one attack" and that the government will take a "right decision at the right time" .   Congratulating the security forces for "foiling" the attack, the party said India is capable of giving a "befitting" reply" to such terror strikes. "BJP condemns it. Our brave soldiers have foiled the terror attack on the air base. We congratulate our armed forces that they were able to thwart it with their wisdom and valour. India is capable of giving a befitting reply to any terror attack," party secretay Shrikant Sharma said.      READ ALSO   Punjab strike subjects PM's Pak policy to pol pressure test    The party said it would see how Pakistan reacts to the attack, coming as it does just a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi stopped by Lahore on way back from Afghanistan to meet Nawaz Sharif.   According to sources, future engagement would depend on how much the Nawaz Sharif government is found to be "cooperating" with the Indian authorities in the aftermath of the attack.   Asked about the possible impact of the terror strike on the Indo-Pak talks, Sharma said, "Right decision will be taken at the right time."     READ ALSO   Congress questions Modi's Pak policy    BJP has traditionally taken a tough stand on the issue of terror, especially one emanating from Pakistan and any dilution of the terror plank will be seen as a turn-around and go down adversely with its core vote-bank. Hence, it is at odds that the terror strike and peace talks will go on together.   Home minister Rajnath Singh asserted that India wanted friendship with Pakistan but will forcefully respond to any act of terrorism. "Much as we want to have good relations with our neighbours including Pakistan our forces will give befitting reply in case of terror attacks," he said.   Environment minister Prakash Javadekar batted for continuation of talks with the neighbouring country, saying "unless you talk terror, terror will not come down".   Javdekar also said, "This process (talks) cannot be destroyed... due to the attack... You cannot change your neighbour... therefore we must continue with the talks but talks have to be mainly on the issue of terrorism and that's what exactly India is doing," Javadekar said. In the wake of Saturday’s attack on Pathankot airbase by Pak-based terrorists, BJP said the resumed dialogue cannot be revoked due to “one attack” and that the government will take a “right decision at the right time”
'Terrorist attacks beginning to affect internal security' SURAT: Ahmed Patel, Congress MP in Rajya Sabha, on Saturday said the terror attack on Indian Air Force base in Pathankot, Punjab, by militants from across the border gives rise to several questions.    "A few days ago Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Pakistan and met Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. And soon after his visit, a terrorist attack has taken place in Punjab. This raises serious questions and we need to ponder over the situation as informal interactions and biryani diplomacy have not been of any help. What we need is result-oriented talks," Ahmed Patel, political adviser to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, told reporters near here.    The Congress leader was at Vesma near Navsari to inaugurate a girl's high school. "The Modi government needs to take the issue of terrorism seriously. Congress is ready to work with the government on this issue provided we are consulted. We all must fight this threat of terrorism together because the three recent attacks by terrorists in J&K and Punjab have begun to affect the country's internal security," he told TOI over phone.    Speaking at Vesma, Patel stressed on the need for skill development among students. The UPA government in 2013 had provided skill development training to 35 lakh students. The NDA government last year could only manage to give training in different categories to 72% of this number, he claimed.   Ahmed Patel, Congress MP in Rajya Sabha, on Saturday said the terror attack on Indian Air Force base in Pathankot, Punjab, by militants from across the border gives rise to several questions.
Attack on Pathankot air base a 'heinous terrorist act': US WASHINGTON: The deadly assault on an Indian air base near the Pakistan border Saturday was "a heinous" terrorist attack, the United States said, urging the two countries to work together to hunt down those responsible.   Three security officers were killed in the attack by suspected Islamist militants on Pathankot base in northern Punjab state earlier Saturday. At least four attackers also died in shootouts with security forces.   The possible involvement of Pakistan-based militants threatens to derail talks between nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan, who have fought three wars since independence in 1947.   "The United States is committed to our strong partnership with the Indian government to combat terrorism," State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement, condemning the assault.   "We urge all countries in the region to work together to disrupt and dismantle terrorist networks and to bring to justice the perpetrators of this heinous act."

US condemns Pathankot terror attackWASHINGTON: Strongly condemning the "heinous" terror attack on a key Indian Air Force base by Pakistani terrorists, the   US  today asked all countries in the region to work together to disrupt and dismantle terrorist networks.   "The United States strongly condemns the terrorist attack on an air force base in the Indian state of Punjab on January 2. We extend our condolences to the victims and their families," State Department spokesman   John Kirby  said.   The US is committed to its strong partnership with the Indian government to combat terrorism, he said in a statement.   "We urge all countries in the region to work together to disrupt and dismantle terrorist networks and to bring to justice the perpetrators of this heinous act," Kirby said.   Heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists yesterday attempted to storm the Air Force base in Pathankot, triggering a day-long gunbattle in which three security men and all the five infiltrators were killed.   Three other security men succumbed to injuries in a hospital later and one NSG member was killed while defusing the grenade at the scene of the terror attack, taking the toll of Indian security personnel to seven.   The attackers were believed to have infiltrated from Pakistan and there was speculation that they may belong to Jaish-e-Mohammad headed by Maulana Masood Azhar of the Kandahar hijack episode.

Was Pathankot strike plotted by Pakistan army's general headquarters? NEW DELHI: The   Pathankot  attack may have been masterminded by the   Pakistan  army's general headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, as per an assessment by senior officials of the Indian security establishment.   According to a senior intelligence official, the GHQ is reportedly peeved at the positive reaction of the global community and media to PM Narendra Modi's Lahore diplomacy and   Nawaz Sharif  's hospitality and feels bypassed after the "fait accompli".   Though there were suggestions that the Pakistan   army  had backed the recent peace outreach, this narrative disagrees and feels ISI too is of the view that Modi's surprise visit created a favourable civil society sentiment in Pakistan towards the civilian 'pro-peace' regime.                      The Pakistan army and ISI, this time around, kept aside their preferred agent   Lashkar-e-Taiba , responsible for the 2008-26-11 strikes on Mumbai, and chose Jaish-e-Mohammed, an ISI asset less in the news, to hit Pathankot. This, they felt, would ensure more deniability . Headed by Maulana Masood Azhar, one of three terrorists swapped to end the IC-814 hostage crisis of 1999, Jaish is being resurrected over the past few years.   Sources said the objective of the attack was to damage air force base assets and technical assets and kill as many personnel as possible. This, some senior intelligence officials feel, was meant to provoke the Indian defence establishment and political opposition to retaliate -undo the peace dialogue and thus scuttle the foreign secretary level talks less than a fortnight away . This would also help bring back focus on Pakistani military propaganda painting their country a victim of terror, facing an aggressive eastern neighbour (India) and an India-influenced Afghanistan.     Pathankot,Pakistan,Nawaz Sharif,Lashkar-e-Taiba,ArmySources said the objective of the attack was to damage air force base assets and technical assets and kill as many personnel as possible.
Did terrorists use the same intrusion point for Pathankot and Gurdaspur attacks?PATHANKOT: The   terrorists  who attacked the   Pathankot  Indian Air Force base may have infiltrated into India at the same point as the perpetrators of the July 27   Gurdaspur  terror attack. Police officers have again pointed to the   BSF    border  outpost at   Bamiyal  in Pathankot as their possible point of entry .   Bamiyal is barely 40km from Dinanagar with a population of around 700, mostly defence personnel. The National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) analysed the data in the GPS devices recovered from the three dead terrorists immediately after the Gurdaspur attack, and found 12 different pre-fed locations in the devices which confirmed Punjab Police's stand.   However, BSF has consistently maintained that the   Lashkar-e-Taiba  militants who attacked Gurdaspur's Dinanagar police station had not breached Punjab's international border. Top officials told TOI they didn't find anything untoward during their search operation on Friday .   Experts said the BSF should find out if there are tunnels between India and   Pakistan  along the border which may be big enough for men to use. That drug smugglers from Pakistan use smaller tunnels to slip contraband into India is already a well-established fact among security agencies. "The best targets for terro rists to strike at are those which can be reached after one night's travel, may be on foo or by a small vehicle, and both Dinanagar and Pathankot fit into this category ," Punjab Frontier BSF ex-inspector general M S Malhi told TOI. He said the area along the Pakistan border in Punjab has rivers, tributaries, contributories and broken ground where rivers criss-cross at several places. This makes surveillance difficult. "Either the terrorists know some major weakness on the border or they have dug a tunnel," he says.   His strong suspicion is that there is a tunnel. "This is the reason they are striking a their will in this region despite there being so much security at the border," he added. In the past, BSF had detected a couple of tunnels connecting India and Pakistan. Malhi added that terrorist organisations start digging tunnels in September after monsoon and use them for infiltration between December and February . "Inspectors general of frontiers of both Punjab and Jammu should constitute a joint team to patrol these hostile terrains."   Another retired BSF IG Himmat Singh said the many small and rivulets entering Punjab from Jammu make sneaking by terrorists easier. Besides, immediately af ter crossing the border, terrorists have access to roads to reach their target.

State on high alert after Pathankot terror attack AHMEDABAD: The state and city police were put on alert after a group of terrorists attacked the Indian Air Force (IAF) station at Pathankot, early morning on Saturday . While patrol and vehicle checking have been stepped up, top police officials assessed security arrangements at important locations and business installations.   Shivanand Jha, city police commissioner, said that they had sounded an alert soon after the attack, and had followed the procedure covering check points, deployment of quick re sponse teams (QRTs) and stringent vehicle checking.   Atop state police official told TOI that the alert about ambush attack had come from central intelligence agencies a few days before January 1, where agencies had warned against a lone wolf or group attack by armed persons from terror outfits, such as Jaish-e-Mohammad, targeting strategic locations.   "The state police were put on alert since that day when security was assessed at important locations and coordination meets were held between various security agencies. The alert would continue as city and district units and state anti-terrorist squad (ATS) tries their best to gather local intelligence and address any contingency ," said the official.   Ahmedabad and Surat had been targeted by Indian Mujahideen (IM) in 2008 by planting a number of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) across the city, whereas Akshardham in Gandhinagar witnessed attack by Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) in 2002. The state and city police were put on alert after a group of terrorists attacked the Indian Air Force (IAF) station at Pathankot, early morning on Saturday . While patrol and vehicle checking have been stepped up, top police officials assessed security arrangements at important locations and business installations.
Dismissed Pakistani spy Ranjith K K knew of Pathankot strikeBATHINDA: The Pakistani   spy  arrested from   Bhisiana Air Force station , near Bathinda, on December 28 by the Delhi police had told his interrogators that there was a plan to target   Pathankot  air base, said intelligence sources. However, the attack was launched before security agencies could act on this.    Sources said Pathankot had figured in the conversations between dismissed IAF airman   Ranjith K K , caught for passing secret information about defence installations to Pakistan's ISI, and his woman handler from   Pakistan  with whom he had come in contact with on a social networking site. Sources also said Ranjith had visited the Pathankot Air Force station.    Sources said military intelligence had questioned some of the former colleagues of Ranjith to establish whether he had ever shared any details of his activities with them or if other Air Force personnel were aware of his intentions.  spy,Ranjith K K,Pathankot,Pakistan,Bhisiana Air Force stationSources said Pathankot had figured in the conversations between dismissed IAF airman Ranjith K K, caught for passing secret information to Pakistan.
Want to avenge Ajmal Kasab and Afzal Guru's hanging: Terrorist to Pathankot survivorPATHANKOT: The 41-year-old jeweller who was abducted by a group of jihadis on Friday in the carjacked vehicle of the Gurdaspur SP before they attacked the   Pathankot  air base said the terrorists made it plain their objective was to avenge the hanging of   Afzal Guru  and Ajmal Kasab.   Guru was executed in 2013 for his role in the 2001 attack on Parliament masterminded by Jaish-e-Mohammad.   Ajmal Kasab , caught alive during the 2611 Mumbai carnage, was hanged in 2012.   "They kept mentioning Guru's and Kasab's names while punching me in anger. They raised anti-India slogans and repeatedly said they would launch big strikes in India to avenge their death," said Rajesh Kumar Verma, who is undergoing treatment at a Pathankot hospital.Verma, whose neck was slit by the jihadis, said he made no effort to communicate with them and feigned unconsciousness.    Will give befitting reply, says Rajnath    Home minister   Rajnath Singh  on Saturday did not rule out the role of   Jaish-e-Mohammed  in the Pathankot attack. He said, "Pakistan is our neighbour. We want good relations with not just Pakistan but all neighbours. But if there is any terror attack on India, we will give a befitting reply," he said.

Pathankot: A key airbase in war and peaceCHANDIGARH: Barely 40km from the   Pakistan  border the   Pathankot  Air Force station is one of the strate gically important forward airbases of India during war and peacetime.   The station is a defensive airfield due its proximity to Pakistan and vital for tactically offensive oper ations of the IAF. It provides logistic support to J&K.   The Pathankot   airbase  along with the airfield at Amritsar provide an essen tial operational range for deep air raids into Pakistan It houses MiG-21 Bison fighter jets and MI-25 and MI-35 attack helicopters. Be sides this, it has Pechora surface-to-air missiles, oth er air defence missiles and surveillance radars. The station witnessed many at tacks during the wars with Pakistan in 1965 and 1971.   During the 1965 War, Pakistan army's commandos had raided Pathankot air base and other forwards air bases, including Adampur and Halwara, in Punjab.   In 1971, Pakistan launched an air strike on Pathankot airbase and dam aged a portion of the runway. Though   IAF  veterans are happy at no loss to high value assets in Friday's attack, they are of the view that such vital airbases, located in operational areas should be guarded by the Army or by specialised forces.   Air Marshal   Randhir Singh  (retired), former commander of the South Western Air Command, said, "Air force is a technical force. Learning lessons from such attacks, the Centreshould ensure their security by specialised forces."    Cops: Terrorists may have got local support    Punjab police are investigating if the fidayeen who attacked the Pathankot Air Force station had local contacts that provided them logistical support and details about the region's topography. Sources said after crossing the international border, the terrorists first contacted taxi driver Ikaagar Singh who they questioned about the location of Pathankot air force base. When Ikaagar got suspicious, they slit his throat. "It's yet to be confirmed if they used an Indian SIM card to call Ikaagar or if the call was made from a Pakistani SIM," an official said. A senior police officer said they believe that terrorists already knew the place. "We are not sure of any local support, we don't rule out the possibility" he said.

Pathankot strike: Intelligence agencies intercepted four calls, including one to a terrorist’s motherNEW DELHI: The JeM fidayeen were in touch not only with their Pakistan-based handlers ahead of the   Pathankot  attack but one of them even took out time to contact his mother. "I am on a suicide mission," he repeated twice before telling her that "Allah will take care of all of us". Strangely , his mother ended the 70second call, made around 1.58 am, by asking her son to eat before laying down his life.   The other three   calls  were purely business. All conversations intercepted by Indian   intelligence  agencies, were in Punjabi laced with a distinct Multani dialect. The first, at 12.30 am, lasted 55 seconds. The second was made at around 12.52 am and lasted 32 seconds. The third, the longest at 87 seconds, was made at 1.10 am. "Control me hai?" asked a man on the other side. "Haan," one terrorist replied. The handler can then be heard asking the   terrorists  to "enter target". "Helicopters aur   planes  ko uda do(Blow up the choppers and planes)," he orders them. "Use samjhao, hame fikr hai," he adds. Agencies are trying to decipher this statement.    Times View    To call off the proposed talks with   Pakistan  because of this attack would be a mistake. It is no secret that there is a string section within the Pakistani 'deep state' that is hostile to the idea of peace with India. If India responds to every terrorist attack on its soil launched from within Pakistan by putting the process of talks on hold, it would play into the hands of these elements. It makes more sense to strengthen the hands of pro-peace elements in Pakistan, including the civilian government, by staying engaged. On its part, the Pakistani government must show real intent in curbing the use of its territory for attacks on India.

Pathankot station key forward airbase for war, peacetime opsChandigarh: Located barely 40km away from the Pakistan border, the Pathankot Air Force station is one of the most strategic forward airbases in India for both war and peacetime surveillance. The station is not only a defensive airfield in view of its proximity to Pakistan, it is also a vital airbase for tactically offensive operations.    It provides logistical support to the entire Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) theatre, including Ladakh. The Pathankot airbase and the airfield in Amritsar provide essential operational range for deep air raids into Pakistani territory.    The airbase houses Mig-21 Bison fighter jets, MI-25 and MI-35 attack helicopters. Besides, it also has the Pechora missile - a surface to air missile, other air defence missiles and surveillance radars. There were many attacks here during the 1965 and 1971 wars.    During the 1965 war, Pakistan commandos from the special services group (SSG) raided Pathankot airbase and other forward airbases, including Adampur and Halwara in Punjab. In Pathankot, the wind acted against Pakistan, scattering their commandos.    Only an officer mess was blown up in the raid and no loss was caused to the aircraft. Some of the raiders were caught while some managed to get back to Pakistan. In 1971, Pakistan launched an air strike on Pathankot airbase and managed to damage part of the runway with rockets and bombs.    Even though Air Force veterans are happy that there was no loss to high value assets in Friday's attack, they are of the view that such vital airbases located in operational areas should be guarded by the Army or specialized forces. At present, airbases are guarded by the Defence Security Corps (DSC), a force comprising retired military personnel, Air Force police and Garud commandos.    Garud commandos of the Air Force are trained on the lines of the National Security Guard (NSG), Army's para commandos and marine commandos (MARCOS), but they are limited in number and trained for combat search and rescue. They are sent to act as an emergency response team (ERT) to tackle threat. DSC comprises mainly superannuated soldiers who are reemployed for a few years.    Noted veteran Air Marshal Randhir Singh (retired), former commander of the South Western Air Command, said, "The Air Force is a technical force where we fly aircraft or provide technical support to aircraft. Learning lessons from attacks on airbases, the Union ministry of defence should ensure their security from specialized forces."    Another veteran, Air Commodore Jawahar Lal Bhargava (retd), who was made a prisoner of war (POW) in 1971 by Pakistan, said the time has come when security of airbases should be considered paramount and not left in the hands of the DSC, which has retirees from the armed forces or technical persons.   Located barely 40km away from the Pakistan border, the Pathankot Air Force station is one of the most strategic forward airbases in India for both war and peacetime surveillance.
Terror leaking into state from same point?Pathankot: The terrorists who attacked Pathankot air force base may have infiltrated into India at the same point as the perpetrators of the July 27 Gurdaspur terror attack. Police officials have again pointed to the Border Security Force (BSF) border outpost (BOP) at Bamiyal in Pathankot as the possible place of their entry.    Bamiyal is barely 40 km from Dinanagar. It has a population of barely 700, mostly defence personnel. Immediately after the Gurdaspur attack, National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) had analysed the data in the GPS devices recovered from the three dead terrorists. They found 12 different pre-fed locations in the devices which confirmed Punjab Police's stand.    However, BSF officials have consistently maintained that the Lashkar-e-Taiba militants who attacked Gurdaspur's Dinanagar police station had not breached Punjab's international border. The force has not budged from this line even after Saturday's attack. Top officials told TOI that they didn't find anything untoward during their search operation on Friday.    Experts say BSF should find out if there are tunnels between India and Pakistan along the border which may be big enough for men to use. That drug smugglers from Pakistan use smaller tunnels to slip contraband into India is already a well-established fact among security agencies.

"Inspectors general of frontiers of both Punjab and Jammu should constitute a joint team to patrol these hostile terrains."    Another retired BSF IG Himmat Singh said the many small and rivulets entering Punjab from the Jammu region make sneaking of terrorists easier. Besides, immediately after crossing the border, terrorists have access to roads to reach their target and strike.    "In this case also they didn't reach Pathankot air force base by chance but it was pre planned," he said. He didn't rule out the possibility of terrorists entering from Jammu and Kashmir border. "But then there is high alert and level of checking must be very high," he said.   The terrorists who attacked Pathankot air force base may have infiltrated into India at the same point as the perpetrators of the July 27 Gurdaspur terror attack.

Pathankot attack to spoil Indo-Pakistan ties: Kalraj Mishra COIMBATORE: Describing the terrorist attack at key Air Force base in Pathankot near international border as "unfortunate", Union minister   Kalraj Mishra  today said it was an attempt to spoil relationship between India and Pakistan.   Terrorists who could not digest the "good atmosphere" created by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent Lahore stopover engineered yesterday's attack, he told reporters here.   "Not only in India and Pakistan, good atmosphere has been created across the globe by Modi's visit. However, the terrorists have targeted the air force (base) trying to spoil the relationship between the neighbouring countries," the Union MSME minister said.   Replying to a question, Mishra rejected charges of intelligence failure.   "Not at all. Intelligence was giving information on a minute to minute basis and that is why we succeeded in stopping them. None of the terrorists will be allowed inside the country," he asserted.   Mishra, a senior BJP leader from Uttar Pradesh, dismissed the possibilities of opposition parties putting up a mega alliance on the lines of 'maha gathbandhan' in Bihar in his state for 2017 assembly elections, saying "it won't work out".   The battle would be between BJP,   Samajwadi Party  and Bahujan Samaj Party, he added.

Indigenous defence production must for India's self-reliance: PM Narendra ModiTUMAKURU:   Prime Minister    Narendra Modi  today said India should focus on indigenous defence production to become self-reliant in the area of security.    "If India has to be self-reliant in the area of security according to our armed forces needs, we have to make our own weapons," he said.    Laying the foundation stone for a Rs 5,000 crore greenfield helicopter project of   HAL  at Biderhalla Kaval in the district, Modi said government was encouraging defence manufacturing driven by the country's scientists and engineers.    In his address to a large gathering at the event, Modi said   Indian Armed Forces  were ready to make any sacrifice for the country and they were second to none.    "But the time has come now to ensure that the weapons and equipment they carried and used were also the best in the world," he said.    Imported weapons were expensive and India spends huge sums of money for the purpose, Modi said.    "We import weapons from other countries to equip our armed forces. India not only spends crores of rupees but also gets relatively not so latest technology," he said.    Modi said before striking a deal for imports, the Indian government, while entering into an agreement, seeks from the seller nations manufacturing part of the weapons in India.    On the HAL helicopter project, the Prime Minister said: "I have confidence that they (HAL) will produce 600 helicopters in the next 15 years."    He said the project is expected to bring in huge investments to Tumakuru district and generate 4000 jobs directly or indirectly.    "What is being set up here is no ordinary factory and very soon this district is going to come on the world map," Modi told the gathering.    According to HAL Chairman and Managing Director Suvarna Raju, the facility gives boost to the country's aviation capability in the helicopter segment as it will produce three to 10 tonnes class helicopters.    The helicopter facility, for which Karnataka government has allotted 610 acres, will house composite parts manufacturing unit and helicopter transmission manufacturing unit.    HAL will also build an integrated township.    To begin with, HAL expects light utility helicopter to fly out from this facility once the plant gets ready.    Advanced light helicopter Dhruv, multi-role new generation helicopter in 5.5 tonne weight class, indigenously designed and developed by HAL, will also be made at the facility.    Modi hoped that the defence undertaking here would ensure that the first chopper flies out from the unit in 2018.    He also recalled the country had to import grains to feed the population but a clarion call by former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri "Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan" changed that as farmers got inspired and made India self-sufficient in foodgrains.  Prime Minister,Narendra Modi,Indian Armed Forces,HAL"If India has to be self-reliant in the area of security according to our armed forces needs, we have to make our own weapons," Modi said.

Pakistan needs to curb terrorist and other outfits: VK SinghNEW DELHI: In the wake of terror attack at Pathankot Air Force base, Union Minister   VK Singh  today said   Pakistan  needs to check terrorist and other organisations acting against India, which is trying to improve bilateral ties.   The former Army chief said that the civilian government in Pakistan should be strengthened to help maintain friendly ties with the neighbouring country and take forward the hopes kindled among the common people of Pakistan after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit there.   "In Pakistan, there are different agencies - there is an elected government, the Army and ISI, whose agenda probably is set by the Army or has its own agenda, and there are terrorist organisations. All have their different paths and work on them differently. The civilian government there has to be strengthened.   "The way after Modiji's visit, hopes have been generated among the common people of Pakistan that there should be friendship and good ties between the two countries. This is a good thing and needs to be taken forward. But at the same time, the other things that I mentioned, there needs to be a curb on such things," the Minister of State for External Affairs said.   He also lauded the way the security agencies foiled the terror attack and fought against terrorists in Pathankot.   Another Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said the government follows zero tolerance policy on terrorism and was committed to national security and would befittingly respond to any terrorist attack.   "India has given a clear message to all terrorists and their bosses that India is not at all tolerant towards terror. We do not compromise on issues which involve our national security," he said.   Naqvi said, "We want that peace should prevail in the world, but if terrorist outfits want to thwart that peace process then they would be given a befitting reply by our security forces."

Pathankot attack: Sushma Swaraj meets ex-diplomats, former envoys to PakistanNEW DELHI: External Affairs Affairs   Sushma Swaraj  here on Sunday met two former foreign secretaries and five former envoys to   Pakistan  as the government sought wider consultation over its policy towards Pakistan in the wake of the terror attack on the Indian Air Force base in Pathankot that claimed 13 lives, including those of seven Indian security personnel.   Sushma Swaraj met Shiv Shankar Menon, former foreign secretary and national security adviser; Shyam Saran, former foreign secretary; Satinder Lambah, former envoy to Pakistan and former special envoy to the prime minister who conducted back channel talks with Pakistan; and four former envoys to Pakistan, T.C.A. Raghavan, Sharad Sabharwal, Satyabrata Pal and G. Parthasarathy.   Raghavan, who retired as India's high commissioner to Pakistan on December 31, was present when Prime Minister Narendra Modi made his surprise stopover in Lahore to greet Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on his birthday.   Ministry officials refrained from giving details of Sunday's meeting.   Modi's surprise visit to Lahore had signalled a thaw in India-Pakistan relations but Saturday's Pathankot terror attack is seen as an attempt by forces across the border to derail the proposed foreign secretary-level talks in Islamabad in the middle of this month.   Modi's visit was the culmination of a series of diplomatic engagements between the two South Asian neighbours starting from November 30 last year when he had a seemingly impromptu meeting with Sharif at the Paris climate summit.   Following this, on December 6, Indian National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and his Pakistani counterpart Naseer Khan Janjua held a meeting in Bangkok which was also attended by Foreign Secretaries S. Jaishankar and Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry.   Two days later, Sushma Swaraj landed in Islamabad to attend the Heart of Asia conference which engages "heart of Asia" countries for a peaceful and stable Afghanistan.   On December 9, she told the media there that Modi would visit Islamabad next year to attend the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) summit.   Then, after a courtesy call on Sharif, she held a bilateral with his advisor on foreign affairs, Sartaj Aziz.   The two then came out with a joint statement in which Pakistan assured India that all steps were being taken to expedite the early conclusion of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack trial.   "Both sides, accordingly, agreed to a comprehensive bilateral dialogue and directed the the foreign secretaries to work out the modalities and schedule of the meetings under the dialogue, including peace and security, CBMs (confidence buildins measures), Jammu and Kashmir, Siachen, Sir Creek, Wullar Barrage/Tulbul Navigation Project, economic and commercial cooperation, counter-terrorism, narcotics control, humanitarian issues, people-to-people exchanges and religious tourism," the statement said.   Even as the stage was being set for the foreign secretary-level meeting between the two sides came the   Pathankot attack  that is being deemed as an attack on the softening of ties between New Delhi and Islamabad.

It’s a different mode of shooting for Gagan nowGagan ke us paar! Well, ace shooter and 2012 London Olympics bronze medallist Gagan Narang had different targets to shoot in the early hours of Saturday morning! This famous Hyderabadi, who had already booked a slot for the 2016 Rio Olympics, was on his maiden trip of bird watching armed – not with a gun – with the latest camera equipment to capture some of the wonderful creations of the nature. Interestingly, the 32-year-old Gagan, who returned to the city only a couple of days ago from what he calls an “immensely satisfying trip” to Ranthambore National Park in Rajasthan, took time off from his busy training schedule to have a look at the different species of birds which have made Ameenpur Lake near BHEL their ‘home’. And, like in the shooting ranges, Gagan was spot on straight away – capturing the image of a cormorant catching the fish. “Oh! I got it. Considering this is my first trip of bird watching, though I did shoot some birds in Ranthambore, it has been a wonderful experience to be here at the lake,” he exclaimed later with a sense of pride. And, as the shooter was making gentle steps not to disturb the birds which were busy in their own world, Gagan’s delight in spotting the kingfisher perched on a thin branch of a bush was understandable given his love for the nature. For someone who has been taking pictures across the world whenever he had time and not competing in shooting competitions for close to a decade now, Gagan loves photography and his knowledge of the camera and the minute details is pretty startling. “I love these birds in flight for they are such a visual delight,” says Gagan even while having a look after freezing in his camera the kingfisher trying to take-off. The painted storks and the stilts at the lake also saw his face lit up as he positioned to ‘capture’ them in his camera. “There are few better places in this world than a locale which keeps you closer to the nature and far away from the madding crowd. I tell you once you see the Bengal Tiger in the reserve; it keeps coming back to you. It has magic in its eyes,” says Gagan apparently pleased with what has been a highly successful trip. And, the champion sportsperson signs off with a promise that he would keep visiting these kind of places to continue his romance with the flora and fauna.This famous Hyderabadi, who had already booked a slot for the 2016 Rio Olympics, was on his maiden trip of bird watching armed – not with a gun – with the latest camera equipment to capture some of th
Attack on Indian consulate in Afghanistan foiledEven as the operation against terrorists at the Pathankot airbase continued on Sunday, the Indian consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif in Northern Afghanistan came under attack from four armed terrorists. The terrorists were still engaged in heavy gunbattle with the Special forces of the Afghanistan police. As per latest report available at 4 am on Monday, two of them were hiding in the adjacent building and special forces were trying to break into the main entrance with the help of armoured vehicle. The Indian consulate building continued to receive splinters, as the terrorists were firing from RPGs.  The commandos of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) force, which guards the consulate building, were the first to engage with the terrorists for almost an hour and were able to thwart the attack.  DG ITBP Krishna Chowdhury told  : “Our men engaged with the terrorists and managed to stop them before they could inflict any damage.  The Afghan National Police had reached the consulate building by then and took over after that.”  The officer added that the firing was directed at the consulate from an adjacent building and there were at least four armed men. Two of them were reported to have been killed.  At 10.27 p.m. a rocket-propelled grenade was fired, which hit Alamas hall, a wedding venue near the consulate building, which also houses the residence of Noorulah, deputy to the Vice-President of Afghanistan.

Pathankot Air Force base terror attack: Search operation continues at Pathankot air base after attackGunshots and a blast were heard from the Indian Air Force (IAF) frontier base near Pathankot town on Sunday morning leading to speculation that one more terrorist could still be holed up inside. While four terrorists, who carried out a Fidayeen attack at the IAF base on Saturday, were killed by security agencies during a gunfight that lasted for 15-hours. There were confusing reports about the fifth terrorist being killed.

IAF helicopters could be seen flying over the base and nearby areas through the night and since early Sunday to assist ground forces in the operations. “The search ops are continuing. Everything is being looked at minutely. The operation will end only after this is completed,” a senior Punjab Police official told   Security agencies were particularly investigating the local support that the terrorists got in the area after entering Indian territory from the border belt with Pakistan on December 30-31.  At least four terrorists, suspected to be from Pakistan, were killed in a gunfight that lasted over 15 hours after they breached a high-security perimeter and entered the IAF base in northern Punjab early on Saturday to carry out a Fidayeen attack.Pathankot attack, Pathankot air force base attack, Pakistani militants, search operations,India, Punjab, crime, law and justice, terrorism (crime), defence, armed Forces, security measuresGunshots and a blast were heard from the Indian Air Force (IAF) frontier base near Pathankot town on Sunday morning leading to speculation that one more terrorist could still be holed up inside.Wh

Pathankot Air Force base attack: Six security personnel killed, Defence Ministry confirmsEnding confusion on the casualties among security forces in the  , Defence Ministry officials on Sunday confirmed that six soldiers had lost their lives.  The six include one Garud commando and five soldiers from the Defence Security Corps (DSC) while one Garud commando and eight DSC personnel were injured.  “Additional casualties are because three DSC personnel passed away in the hospital during the night,” officials said.

Striking similarities in Pathankot Air Force Base attacks  There are striking similarities between Saturday’s terror attack on the Pathankot Air Force Base and last year’s July 27 attack in the neighbouring Gurdaspur district of Punjab, where 10 persons were killed. In both the incidents, the alleged terrorists struck in districts close to the Pakistan border and snatched vehicles to execute their plan. In Saturday’s attack, three defence personnel were said to have been killed along with four terrorists. Just as reported during the Gurdaspur incident, this time also the terrorists are suspected to have come at least two days prior to the attack and were found to be moving freely in Army fatigues, without being checked or intercepted by any security force personnel. During the Gurdaspur attack, the accused were using GPS devices and stormed a police station. This time too, a defence installation was attacked. “The similarity between the two places being that it also housed the families of police personnel [Gurdaspur] and the Air Force personnel in Pathankot’s case. Maybe the idea was to inflict maximum casualties,” said a senior investigating officer. In both the operations, the terrorists engaged the security forces for more than 10 hours. Though the Border Security Force had ruled out that the three terrorists involved in the Gurdaspur attack entered India after crossing the Ravi, which flows near the Pakistan border, this time they said they were yet to come to any conclusion. “On our part we have checked the border areas and have not found any sign of forced entry but it cannot be denied every time. The fact is they are coming from somewhere. We have also checked border areas for any possible presence of tunnel but haven’t found any,” said a senior BSF officer.There are striking similarities between Saturday’s terror attack on the Pathankot Air Force Base and last year’s July 27 attack in the neighbouring Gurdaspur district of Punjab, where 10 persons were

ISI, Pakistan army responsible for Pathankot attack: J&K Deputy CM Jammu and Kashmir Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh on Sunday said Pakistan’s intelligence agency ISI and its army were responsible for the   in which seven security personnel were killed. “The entire atmosphere is being vitiated by the ISI, the (Pakistani) army and the separatist groups and their henchmen who have done this (attacked the Air Force base),” Singh said on the sidelines of a function here. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had taken a daring step by visiting Pakistan last month, however the forces who do not want peace vitiated the atmosphere, he said. “Whatever the issue is, it has to be resolved through dialogue. Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a big daring step, a major diplomatic step...while on his way back from Afghanistan, (he) went to Lahore and attended the marriage ceremony at the house of Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif,” he said. “That (the visit) sent a message, but the entire atmosphere is being vitiated by the ISI, the army and the separatist groups and their henchmen who have done this,” he said. The central government was reviewing the situation and will take further steps keeping in mind the interests of the people of the country, he said. Appreciating the role played by the security forces, Singh said that they played a commendable role in containing the attack. “Yesterday’s incident...I must say that our security forces, the army, the Punjab police have done a wonderful job, the three men who laid down their life for the nation as the terrorists neutralised by the security forces were fully equipped,” he said. He further said that the incident sends a message to Pakistan and the agencies there that the Indian security agencies won’t let their nefarious designs succeed in India. “So this sends a message to Pakistan and the agencies in Pakistan that are doing this, that such type of actions won’t succeed here. “This is clear message to them that as far as our security is concerned, there is no compromise on it. And we also agree that all the issues can be resolved only through dialogue,” he said.

The PM’s statement, which didn’t name any organisation directly, was significant as it leaves a window open for the dialogue process with Pakistan to continue that PM Modi gave a personal boost to with his visit to Lahore just a week before the attack. Officials told  , India had expected “some attempts” to derail the talks, but it is now a “test of Pakistan’s intentions” on terror. “What is key is how Pakistan responds to the attack, and whether we see only bland denials of the past, or an offer to fight terror together.” The official indicated that in the past Pakistan had walked the talk briefly, when it cracked down on some operatives of the Hizbul Mujahideen in 2004 after then President Musharraf made his famous speech. “They only have to follow through on that commitment now.”  Officials also said much would depend on which way the evidence leads, and whether there was a direct link between the attackers to Pakistani intelligence, and whether the newly formed NSA mechanism could be used to track the perpetrators.  In its official statement condemning the “terrorist attack”, Pakistan too made it clear that it understands Pathankot operations would have a bearing on talks between the two countries, noting that it wished to “build on the goodwill created by the high level contacts between the two countries.” Pakistan also said it was committed to “partner with India” to “completely eradicate the menace of terrorism”. The statement, that refers to the attack in India as a “terrorist attack” is rare, especially given its support for groups attacking India, and came even as the fighting was underway.  However, if the attack constitutes a test of Pakistan’s reactions, it is also the first test of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s outreach to Pakistan. In the past, India has reacted differently to various incidents: from PM Vajpayee mobilising troops after the parliament attack in December 2000, to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh pausing the talks after the Mumbai attacks in 2008 and calling them off altogether after the beheading of Indian soldiers in January 2013, when he said there can be no “business as usual” after the attack. However just 9 months later, he restarted talks, and went ahead with meeting Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in New York after the Samba camp attack in September 2013. “We will not allow the enemies of peace to derail dialogue,” Dr. Singh said at the time.  Will Mr. Modi’s latest peace pitch to Pakistan and statement on not allowing the “enemies of humanity to succeed” mean talks between between the foreign secretaries who are due to meet in Islamabad in mid January, are still on track? "This process cannot be destroyed due to one attack... Pakistan is our neighbour." Union minister Prakash Javadekar said to the press, indicating the dialogue wouldn’t be called off immediately but would be “focussed on terror”.  The Ministry of External Affairs itself stayed away from any comment, saying only during the attack that the “immediate focus” was on resolving the situation, adding that it would be “premature to say anything more at this point”.Pathankot terror attack, Indo-Pak talks,crime, law and justice, terrorism (crime)Adopting a restrained tone on the Pathankot attack, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today called the attackers “enemies of humanity who can’t stand to watch India develop”.

Badal urges Centre to seal border to check terrorismPunjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal on Saturday hailed the security forces for thwarting the attack by a group of heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists at an Air Force base here and urged Centre to “effectively seal” the border to curb the menace of cross-border terrorism. The united effort of the State and Central security agencies have once again foiled the nefarious designs of the anti-national forces, he said. “The entire country salutes these brave hearts that are ever ready to combat any such move,”Mr. Badal said. He said that it was the high time that Centre take a call on cross-border terrorism by “effectively sealing” the border. In a pre-dawn attack, a group of heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists, struck at an Air Force base here in Punjab, leading to a fierce gun-battle in which three security personnel were killed along with four attackers. Interacting with the people at the residence of Ikagar Singh who was killed by the terrorists on Thursday night here, the CM said that State government was fully committed to preserve the peace and communal harmony in Punjab and no one would be allowed to disturb it at any cost. “Ikagar Singh was a national martyr, who laid his life for the country,” Mr. Badal said. The Chief Minister announced a financial assistance of Rs 5 lakh for the Ikagar’s family besides government job for his wife. The State government would also give old age pension to parents of Ikagar, he added. On Thursday night, 4-5 suspected Pakistani terrorists in army uniform had abducted and thrashed a Superintendent of Police and his two associates before dumping them some distance away and speeding away in his vehicle. The body of Ikagar Singh was found near the SP’s abandoned vehicle at a place 35 km from Pathankot. It is believed that the men, who abducted the SP and two others, first snatched Ikagar’s Innova who was on his way back from Kathua in Jammu and Kashmir. They slit his throat and dumped his body near the bridge before fleeing.  Punjab Congress president Amarinder Singh also condemned the terror attack on the Air Force base, saying it was a clear attempt by rogue elements in Pakistan to sabotage the peace process, which must not be allowed to be happen. Noting that the attack took place only a few days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Lahore visit, Capt. Singh hoped that it was not a repeat of what happened after then Prime Minister A. B. Vajpayee’s Lahore bus journey. The Kargil war took place soon after Mr. Vajpayee’s visit. “It is a clear attempt by rogue elements in Pakistan to subvert and sabotage the peace process between the two countries (India and Pakistan) which must not be allowed at any cost”, the Congress Deputy Leader in the Lok Sabha said here. “It is the responsibility of the Pakistan government to identify such elements and deal with them with a firm hand,” he said. He said while the peace process should continue, India at the same time must not lower its guard. “We can’t allow our people, soldiers and police personnel to be killed by the militants from across the border and Pakistan needs to own up responsibility and deal with such elements firmly”, he said, adding, they know where the problem lies and they must resolve it. Capt Amarinder also saluted the martyrs for their bravery. “Even as we grieve your loss, the entire nation is proud of you for the exemplary valour and courage you have shown by killing the terrorists and the nation will always remember your great sacrifice”, he said.-PTIPunjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal on Saturday hailed the security forces for thwarting the attack by a group of heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists at an Air Force base here and urged Centre to

No benefits from PM’s Pak visit, says SenaReiterating its disapproval of the NDA government’s diplomatic attempts to engage with Pakistan despite continuing terror attacks, the Shiv Sena on Saturday asked Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh when will India give a “befitting reply” to Pakistan. Stating that the terror attack at the air force base in Pathankot on Saturday morning was a “gift” India received after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s surprise visit to Lahore, Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha MP and spokesperson Sanjay Raut asked what India achieved from Mr Modi’s unscheduled visit to Lahore. Mr Modi had surprised diplomatic and political circles by visiting Nawaz Sharif’s house to wish him on his birthday. “On one hand, our Prime Minister visits Lahore to build friendly relations with Pakistan, while today’s terror attack establishes that Islamabad has no interest in having friendly relations with India. What did Mr Modi achieve by visiting Lahore in such a hurried manner to meet Nawaz Sharif?,” Mr Raut asked. The Shiv Sena opposed India’s attempts to normalise relations with Pakistan if cross-border terror continued. “Whenever there is an attack on India, there is no need to say who is behind it. We can say with eyes closed that attackers are from Pakistan. The incident has happened after our Prime Minister’s visit to Lahore. We do not want to politicise it but the Pathankot attack is nothing but a gift that has been given to us by Pakistan in return for the Lahore visit,” Mr Raut said. Reiterating Sena’s stance on the issue, Mr Raut said, “We don’t want to play politics but it is a fact that bilateral peace talks and terror attacks are taking place simultaneously. This won’t do and this has been Sena’s stance from the beginning”. Calling for a military response from India, Mr Raut said the Pathankot attack indicated a serious threat to the security of the country. Meanwhile in an editorial in the party mouthpiece on Saturday, the Shiv Sena backed BJP vice president Vinay Sahastrabuddhe’s remark that the BJP had a “smaller talent pool” than the Congress, and suggested that this could well be an expression of RSS’ opinion about the Modi government. “Sahasrabuddhe said there is a dearth of talent within the BJP compared to the Congress. He is a veteran of the Sangh Parivar. He doesn’t indulge in theatrics, but still he spoke the truth. Is this the inner voice of the Sangh Parivar?,” the editorial said. “Sky is the limit for Narendra Modi’s talent as the Prime Minister. But, India is a large country and to govern it, Modi will need a hundred capable hands. What works piecemeal is not durable. That’s probably what Sahasrabuddhe wants to say,” it said.Reiterating its disapproval of the NDA government’s diplomatic attempts to engage with Pakistan despite continuing terror attacks, the Shiv Sena on Saturday asked Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh whe
Countries in the region must work together on terrorism: U.S The United States condemned the terrorist attack on the Indian Air Force base in Pathankot, and “urged all countries in the region to work together to disrupt and dismantle terrorist networks and to bring to justice the perpetrators of this heinous act.”  In a statement, state department spokesperson John Kirby said: “The United States is committed to our strong partnership with the Indian government to combat terrorism.”  U.S has always maintained that Pakistan requires to do more to rein in terrorists that target neighbouring countries. U.S has also been pressing Pakistan for action against perpetrators of the Mumbai terror attack. However, at the same time, the U.S would like India and Pakistan to continue their dialogue. U.S call to the “countries in the region to work together” to tackle terrorism has to be seen in this light.  U.S had welcomed the recent turnaround in the India-Pakistan relations. Washington considers better relations between India and Pakistan good for its South Asia strategy and is keen that the latest terror strike does not disrupt the renewed talks between the two countries.Pathankot, Countries in the region must work together on terrorism: U.S., Pakistan, India,World, Pakistan, USA, politics, diplomacy, India, politicsThe United States condemned the terrorist attack on the Indian Air Force base in Pathankot, and “urged all countries in the region to work together to disrupt and dismantle terrorist networks and to
Terrorists may have sneaked in through Bamiyal villageNEW DELHI, Jan 2: The five heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists, who carried out the suicide attack on the key Pathankot IAF base in Punjab, are believed to have infiltrated into India during the intervening night of December 30-31 from a spot near Bamiyal village in Pathankot, located close to the international border.The terrorists, official sources said, crossed over near Shakargarh in Pakistan to Bamiyal village and later changed into Army fatigues before kidnapping Salwinder Singh, a Superintendent of Police-rank officer, who was shunted out from Gurdaspur to take charge as Assistant Commandant of 75th battalion of Punjab Armed Police, at Kolian village.There were three occupants in the vehicle when it was hijacked by five militants which included Singh’s jeweller friend Rajesh Verma and the driver.While the terrorists slit the throat of other two, the police officer, who is facing charges of alleged breach of discipline, was released later and the vehicle was abandoned at Tajpur village, a place which is 2 km from the IAF’s Pathankot air base.One of the militants is alleged to have used the phone of the jeweller, who is undergoing treatment in a hospital, to make a call to Bhawalpur in Pakistan which was intercepted by intelligence agencies.After the day -long operation today, all the five terrorists, suspected to be from Jaish-e-Mohammed terror outfit, were eliminated by the joint team of police, army and NSG.The area from where the terrorists crossed over has a thick foliage of elephant grass which provides an automatic cover for them, they said.A tributary of river Beas enters into Pakistan from this village and this route is quite famous for drug smugglers to enter India.
